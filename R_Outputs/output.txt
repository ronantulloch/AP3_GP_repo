START statistical techniques are employed in almost every phase of life surveys are de ENDLINE NEWLINE signed to collect early returns on election day and forecast the outcome of an election ENDLINE NEWLINE consumers are sampled to provide information for predicting product preferences ENDLINE NEWLINE research physicians conduct experiments to determine the effect of various drugs and ENDLINE NEWLINE controlled environmental conditions on humans in order to infer the appropriate treat ENDLINE NEWLINE ment for various illnesses engineers sample a product quality characteristic and var ENDLINE NEWLINE ious controllable process variables to identify key variables related to product quality ENDLINE NEWLINE to ship or hold individual lots economists observe various indices of economic health ENDLINE NEWLINE over a period of time and use the information to forecast the condition of the economy ENDLINE NEWLINE in the future statistical techniques play an important role in achieving the objective ENDLINE NEWLINE of each of these practical situations the development of the theory underlying these ENDLINE NEWLINE techniques is the focus of this text ENDLINE NEWLINE a prerequisite to a discussion of the theory of statistics is a definition of statis ENDLINE NEWLINE tics and a statement of its objectives webster’s new collegiate dictionary defines ENDLINE NEWLINE statistics as “a branch of mathematics dealing with the collection analysis interpre ENDLINE NEWLINE tation and presentation of masses of numerical data” stuart and ord state ENDLINE NEWLINE “statistics is the branch of the scientific method which deals with the data obtained by ENDLINE NEWLINE counting or measuring the properties of populations” rice commenting on ENDLINE NEWLINE experimentation and statistical applications states that statistics is “essentially con ENDLINE NEWLINE cerned with procedures for analyzing data especially data that in some vague sense ENDLINE NEWLINE have a random character” freund and walpole among others view statistics ENDLINE NEWLINE as encompassing “the science of basing inferences on observed data and the entire problem of making decisions in the face of uncertainty” and mood graybill and ENDLINE NEWLINE boes define statistics as “the technology of the scientific method” and add ENDLINE NEWLINE that statistics is concerned with “ the design of experiments and investigations ENDLINE NEWLINE  statistical inference” a superficial examination of these definitions suggests a ENDLINE NEWLINE substantial lack of agreement but all possess common elements each description ENDLINE NEWLINE implies that data are collected with inference as the objective each requires select ENDLINE NEWLINE ing a subset of a large collection of data either existent or conceptual in order to ENDLINE NEWLINE infer the characteristics of the complete set all the authors imply that statistics is a ENDLINE NEWLINE theory of information with inference making as its objective ENDLINE NEWLINE the large body of data that is the target of our interest is called the population and ENDLINE NEWLINE the subset selected from it is a sample the preferences of voters for a gubernatorial ENDLINE NEWLINE candidate jones expressed in quantitative form for “prefer” and for “do not ENDLINE NEWLINE prefer” provide a real finite and existing population of great interest to jones to ENDLINE NEWLINE determine the true fraction who favor his election jones would need to interview ENDLINE NEWLINE all eligible voters—a task that is practically impossible the voltage at a particular ENDLINE NEWLINE point in the guidance system for a spacecraft may be tested in the only three sys ENDLINE NEWLINE tems that have been built the resulting data could be used to estimate the voltage ENDLINE NEWLINE characteristics for other systems that might be manufactured some time in the future ENDLINE NEWLINE in this case the population is conceptual we think of the sample of three as being ENDLINE NEWLINE representative of a large population of guidance systems that could be built using the ENDLINE NEWLINE same method presumably this population would possess characteristics similar to ENDLINE NEWLINE the three systems in the sample analogously measurements on patients in a medical ENDLINE NEWLINE experiment represent a sample from a conceptual population consisting of all patients ENDLINE NEWLINE similarly afflicted today as well as those who will be afflicted in the near future you ENDLINE NEWLINE will find it useful to clearly define the populations of interest for each of the scenarios ENDLINE NEWLINE described earlier in this section and to clarify the inferential objective for each ENDLINE NEWLINE it is interesting to note that billions of dollars are spent each year by us indus ENDLINE NEWLINE try and government for data from experimentation sample surveys and other data ENDLINE NEWLINE collection procedures this money is expended solely to obtain information about ENDLINE NEWLINE phenomena susceptible to measurement in areas of business science or the arts the ENDLINE NEWLINE implications of this statement provide keys to the nature of the very valuable contri ENDLINE NEWLINE bution that the discipline of statistics makes to research and development in all areas ENDLINE NEWLINE of society information useful in inferring some characteristic of a population either ENDLINE NEWLINE existing or conceptual is purchased in a specified quantity and results in an inference ENDLINE NEWLINE estimation or decision with an associated degree of goodness for example if jones ENDLINE NEWLINE arranges for a sample of voters to be interviewed the information in the sample can be ENDLINE NEWLINE used to estimate the true fraction of all voters who favor jones’s election in addition ENDLINE NEWLINE to the estimate itself jones should also be concerned with the likelihood chance ENDLINE NEWLINE that the estimate provided is close to the true fraction of eligible voters who favor his ENDLINE NEWLINE election intuitively the larger the number of eligible voters in the sample the higher ENDLINE NEWLINE will be the likelihood of an accurate estimate similarly if a decision is made regarding ENDLINE NEWLINE the relative merits of two manufacturing processes based on examination of samples ENDLINE NEWLINE of products from both processes we should be interested in the decision regarding ENDLINE NEWLINE which is better and the likelihood that the decision is correct in general the study of ENDLINE NEWLINE statistics is concerned with the design of experiments or sample surveys to obtain a ENDLINE NEWLINE specified quantity of information at minimum cost and the optimum use of this infor ENDLINE NEWLINE mation in making an inference about a population the objective of statistics is to make ENDLINE NEWLINE the mechanism instrumental in making inferences can be well illustrated by analyzing ENDLINE NEWLINE our own intuitive inference making procedures ENDLINE NEWLINE suppose that two candidates are running for a public office in our community ENDLINE NEWLINE and that we wish to determine whether our candidate jones is favored to win the ENDLINE NEWLINE population of interest is the set of responses from all eligible voters who will vote on ENDLINE NEWLINE election day and we wish to determine whether the fraction favoring jones exceeds  ENDLINE NEWLINE for the sake of simplicity suppose that all eligible voters will go to the polls and that ENDLINE NEWLINE we randomly select a sample of from the courthouse roster of voters all are ENDLINE NEWLINE contacted and all favor jones what do you conclude about jones’s prospects for ENDLINE NEWLINE winning the election ENDLINE NEWLINE there is little doubt that most of us would immediately infer that jones will win ENDLINE NEWLINE this is an easy inference to make but this inference itself is not our immediate goal ENDLINE NEWLINE rather we wish to examine the mental processes that were employed in reaching this ENDLINE NEWLINE conclusion about the prospective behavior of a large voting population based on a ENDLINE NEWLINE sample of only people ENDLINE NEWLINE winning means acquiring more than of the votes did we conclude that jones ENDLINE NEWLINE would win because we thought that the fraction favoring jones in the sample was ENDLINE NEWLINE identical to the fraction favoring jones in the population we know that this is prob ENDLINE NEWLINE ably not true a simple experiment will verify that the fraction in the sample favoring ENDLINE NEWLINE jones need not be the same as the fraction of the population who favor him if a bal ENDLINE NEWLINE anced coin is tossed it is intuitively obvious that the true proportion of times it will ENDLINE NEWLINE turn up heads is yet if we sample the outcomes for our coin by tossing it times ENDLINE NEWLINE the proportion of heads will vary from sample to sample that is on one occasion ENDLINE NEWLINE we might observe heads out of flips for a sample proportion of  ENDLINE NEWLINE on another occasion we might observe heads out of flips for a sample pro ENDLINE NEWLINE portion of in fact the sample proportion of heads could be   ENDLINE NEWLINE did we conclude that jones would win because it would be impossible for out ENDLINE NEWLINE of sample voters to favor him if in fact less than of the electorate intended to ENDLINE NEWLINE vote for him the answer to this question is certainly no but it provides the key to ENDLINE NEWLINE our hidden line of logic it is not impossible to draw out of favoring jones when ENDLINE NEWLINE less than of the electorate favor him but it is highly improbable as a result we ENDLINE NEWLINE concluded that he would win ENDLINE NEWLINE theories are conjectures proposed to explain phenomena in the real world as such ENDLINE NEWLINE theories are approximations or models for reality these models or explanations of ENDLINE NEWLINE realityarepresentedinverbalforminsomelessquantitativefieldsandasmathematical ENDLINE NEWLINE relationships in others whereas a theory of social change might be expressed verbally ENDLINE NEWLINE in sociology a description of the motion of a vibrating string is presented in a precise ENDLINE NEWLINE mathematical manner in physics when we choose a mathematical model for a phys ENDLINE NEWLINE ical process we hope that the model reflects faithfully in mathematical terms the ENDLINE NEWLINE attributes of the physical process if so the mathematical model can be used to arrive ENDLINE NEWLINE at conclusions about the process itself if we could develop an equation to predict the ENDLINE NEWLINE position of a vibrating string the quality of the prediction would depend on how well ENDLINE NEWLINE the equation fit the motion of the string the process of finding a good equation is ENDLINE NEWLINE not necessarily simple and usually requires several simplifying assumptions uniform ENDLINE NEWLINE string mass no air resistance etc the final criterion for deciding whether a model ENDLINE NEWLINE is “good” is whether it yields good and useful information the motivation for using ENDLINE NEWLINE mathematical models lies primarily in their utility ENDLINE NEWLINE this text is concerned with the theory of statistics and hence with models of reality ENDLINE NEWLINE we will postulate theoretical frequency distributions for populations and will develop ENDLINE NEWLINE a theory of probability and inference in a precise mathematical manner the net result ENDLINE NEWLINE will be a theoretical or mathematical model for acquiring and utilizing information ENDLINE NEWLINE in real life the model will not be an exact representation of nature but this should ENDLINE NEWLINE not disturb us its utility like that of other theories will be measured by its ability to ENDLINE NEWLINE assist us in understanding nature and in solving problems in the real world ENDLINE NEWLINE the role that probability plays in making inferences will be discussed in detail after ENDLINE NEWLINE an adequate foundation has been laid for the theory of probability at this point we ENDLINE NEWLINE will present an elementary treatment of this theory through an example and an appeal ENDLINE NEWLINE to your intuition ENDLINE NEWLINE the example selected is similar to that presented in section but simpler and ENDLINE NEWLINE less practical it was chosen because of the ease with which we can visualize the ENDLINE NEWLINE population and sample and because it provides an observation producing mechanism ENDLINE NEWLINE for which a probabilistic model will be constructed in section  ENDLINE NEWLINE consider a gambler who wishes to make an inference concerning the balance ENDLINE NEWLINE of a die the conceptual population of interest is the set of numbers that would be ENDLINE NEWLINE generated if the die were rolled over and over again ad infinitum if the die were ENDLINE NEWLINE perfectly balanced one sixth of the measurements in this population would be s ENDLINE NEWLINE one sixth s one sixth s and so on the corresponding frequency distribution is ENDLINE NEWLINE shown in figure  ENDLINE NEWLINE using the scientific method the gambler proposes the hypothesis that the die is ENDLINE NEWLINE balanced and he seeks observations from nature to contradict the theory if false ENDLINE NEWLINE finding the probability of an event defined on a sample space that contains a finite or ENDLINE NEWLINE denumerable countably infinite set of sample points can be approached in two ways ENDLINE NEWLINE the sample point and the event composition methods both methods use the sample ENDLINE NEWLINE space model but they differ in the sequence of steps necessary to obtain a solution ENDLINE NEWLINE and in the tools that are used separation of the two procedures may not be palatable ENDLINE NEWLINE to the unity seeking theorist but it can be extremely useful to a beginner attempting to ENDLINE NEWLINE find the probability of an event in this section we consider the sample point method ENDLINE NEWLINE the event composition method requires additional results and will be presented in ENDLINE NEWLINE section  ENDLINE NEWLINE as our final topic in this chapter we move from theory to application and examine ENDLINE NEWLINE the nature of experiments conducted in statistics a statistical experiment involves the ENDLINE NEWLINE observation of a sample selected from a larger body of data existing or conceptual ENDLINE NEWLINE called a population the measurements in the sample viewed as observations of the ENDLINE NEWLINE values of one or more random variables are then employed to make an inference ENDLINE NEWLINE about the characteristics of the target population ENDLINE NEWLINE how are these inferences made an exact answer to this question is deferred until ENDLINE NEWLINE later but a general observation follows from our discussion in section there we ENDLINE NEWLINE learned that the probability of the observed sample plays a major role in making an ENDLINE NEWLINE inference and evaluating the credibility of the inference ENDLINE NEWLINE without belaboring the point it is clear that the method of sampling will affect ENDLINE NEWLINE the probability of a particular sample outcome for example suppose that a fictitious population contains only n elements from which we plan to take a sample of ENDLINE NEWLINE size n you could mix the elements thoroughly and select two in such a way that ENDLINE NEWLINE all pairs of elements possess an equal probability of selection a second sampling ENDLINE NEWLINE procedure might require selecting a single element replacing it in the population and ENDLINE NEWLINE then drawing a single element again the two methods of sample selection are called ENDLINE NEWLINE sampling without and with replacement respectively ENDLINE NEWLINE if all the n population elements are distinctly different the probability of ENDLINE NEWLINE drawing a specific pair when sampling without replacement is the probability ENDLINE NEWLINE of drawing the same specific pair when sampling with replacement is you can ENDLINE NEWLINE easily verify these results ENDLINE NEWLINE the point that we make is that the method of sampling known as the design of an ENDLINE NEWLINE experiment affects both the quantity of information in a sample and the probability of ENDLINE NEWLINE observing a specific sample result hence every sampling procedure must be clearly ENDLINE NEWLINE described if we wish to make valid inferences from sample to population ENDLINE NEWLINE the study of the design of experiments the various types of designs along with their ENDLINE NEWLINE properties is a course in itself hence at this early stage of study we introduce only the ENDLINE NEWLINE simplest sampling procedure simple random sampling the notion of simple random ENDLINE NEWLINE sampling will be needed in subsequent discussions of the probabilities associated with ENDLINE NEWLINE random variables and it will inject some realism into our discussion of statistics this ENDLINE NEWLINE is because simple random sampling is often employed in practice now let us define ENDLINE NEWLINE the term random sample ENDLINE NEWLINE perfect random sampling is difficult to achieve in practice if the population is not ENDLINE NEWLINE too large we might write each of the n numbers on a poker chip mix all the chips ENDLINE NEWLINE and select a sample of n chips the numbers on the poker chips would specify the ENDLINE NEWLINE measurements to appear in the sample ENDLINE NEWLINE tables of random numbers have been formed by computer to expedite the selection ENDLINE NEWLINE of random samples an example of such a table is table appendix a random ENDLINE NEWLINE number table is a set of integers  generated so that in the long run the ENDLINE NEWLINE table will contain all ten integers in approximately equal proportions with no trends ENDLINE NEWLINE in the patterns in which the digits were generated thus if one digit is selected from ENDLINE NEWLINE a random point on the table it is equally likely to be any of the digits through  ENDLINE NEWLINE choosing numbers from the table is analogous to drawing numbered poker chips ENDLINE NEWLINE from the mixed pile as mentioned earlier suppose we want a random sample of ENDLINE NEWLINE three persons to be selected from a population of seven persons we could number ENDLINE NEWLINE the people from to put the numbers on chips thoroughly mix the chips and then ENDLINE NEWLINE draw three out analogously we could drop a pencil point on a random starting point ENDLINE NEWLINE in table appendix suppose the point falls on the th line of column and we ENDLINE NEWLINE decide to use the rightmost digit of the group of five which is a in this case this ENDLINE NEWLINE process is like drawing the chip numbered we may now proceed in any direction to obtain the remaining numbers in the sample if we decide to proceed down the page ENDLINE NEWLINE the next number immediately below the is a so our second sampled person ENDLINE NEWLINE would be number proceeding we next come to an but there are only seven ENDLINE NEWLINE elements in the population thus the is ignored and we continue down the column ENDLINE NEWLINE two more s then appear but they must both be ignored because person has already ENDLINE NEWLINE been selected the chip numbered has been removed from the pile finally we ENDLINE NEWLINE come to a and our sample of three is completed with persons numbered  and  ENDLINE NEWLINE any starting point can be used in a random number table and we may proceed in ENDLINE NEWLINE any direction from the starting point however if more than one sample is to be used ENDLINE NEWLINE in any problem each should have a unique starting point ENDLINE NEWLINE in many situations the population is conceptual as in an observation made during ENDLINE NEWLINE a laboratory experiment here the population is envisioned to be the infinitely many ENDLINE NEWLINE measurements that would be obtained if the experiment were to be repeated over and ENDLINE NEWLINE over again if we wish a sample of n measurements from this population we ENDLINE NEWLINE repeat the experiment ten times and hope that the results represent to a reasonable ENDLINE NEWLINE degree of approximation a random sample ENDLINE NEWLINE although the primary purpose of this discussion was to clarify the meaning of a ENDLINE NEWLINE random sample we would like to mention that some sampling techniques are only ENDLINE NEWLINE partially random for instance if we wish to determine the voting preference of the ENDLINE NEWLINE nation in a presidential election we would not likely choose a random sample from ENDLINE NEWLINE the population of voters by pure chance all the voters appearing in the sample ENDLINE NEWLINE might be drawn from a single city—say san francisco—which might not be at ENDLINE NEWLINE all representative of the population of all voters in the united states we would ENDLINE NEWLINE prefer a random selection of voters from smaller political districts perhaps states ENDLINE NEWLINE allotting a specified number to each state the information from the randomly selected ENDLINE NEWLINE subsamples drawn from the respective states would be combined to form a prediction ENDLINE NEWLINE concerning the entire population of voters in the country in general we want to select ENDLINE NEWLINE a sample so as to obtain a specified quantity of information at minimum cost ENDLINE NEWLINE this chapter has been concerned with providing a model for the repetition of an ENDLINE NEWLINE experiment and consequently a model for the population frequency distributions of ENDLINE NEWLINE chapter the acquisition of a probability distribution is the first step in forming a ENDLINE NEWLINE theory to model reality and to develop the machinery for making inferences ENDLINE NEWLINE an experiment was defined as the process of making an observation the concepts ENDLINE NEWLINE of an event a simple event the samplespaceandtheprobabilityaxiomshaveprovided ENDLINE NEWLINE a probabilistic model for calculating the probability of an event numerical events ENDLINE NEWLINE and the definition of a random variable were introduced in section  ENDLINE NEWLINE inherent in the model is the sample point approach for calculating the probability ENDLINE NEWLINE of an event section counting rules useful in applying the sample point method ENDLINE NEWLINE were discussed in section the concept of conditional probability the operations ENDLINE NEWLINE of set algebra and the laws of probability set the stage for the event composition ENDLINE NEWLINE method for calculating the probability of an event section  ENDLINE NEWLINE of what value is the theory of probability it provides the theory and the tools ENDLINE NEWLINE for calculating the probabilities of numerical events and hence the probability ENDLINE NEWLINE a less formidable characterization of discrete random variables can be obtained ENDLINE NEWLINE by considering some practical examples the number of bacteria per unit area in ENDLINE NEWLINE the study of drug control on bacterial growth is a discrete random variable as is the ENDLINE NEWLINE number of defective television sets in a shipment of sets indeed discrete random ENDLINE NEWLINE variables often represent counts associated with real phenomena ENDLINE NEWLINE let us now consider the relation of the material in chapter to this chapter why ENDLINE NEWLINE study the theory of probability the answer is that the probability of an observed ENDLINE NEWLINE event is needed to make inferences about a population the events of interest are often ENDLINE NEWLINE numerical events that correspond to values of discrete random variables hence it is ENDLINE NEWLINE imperative that we know the probabilities of these numerical events because certain ENDLINE NEWLINE types of random variables occur so frequently in practice it is useful to have at hand ENDLINE NEWLINE the probability for each value of a random variable this collection of probabilities is ENDLINE NEWLINE called the probability distribution of the discrete random variable we will find that ENDLINE NEWLINE many experiments exhibit similar characteristics and generate random variables with ENDLINE NEWLINE the same type of probability distribution consequently knowledge of the probability ENDLINE NEWLINE distributions for random variables associated with common types of experiments will ENDLINE NEWLINE eliminate the need for solving the same probability problems over and over again ENDLINE NEWLINE if each of the ten people is selected at random from the population then we have ENDLINE NEWLINE ten nearly identical trials with each trial resulting in a person either favoring jones ENDLINE NEWLINE s or not favoring jones f the random variable of interest is then the number of ENDLINE NEWLINE successes in the ten trials for the first person selected the probability of favoring ENDLINE NEWLINE jones s is but what can be said about the unconditional probability that the ENDLINE NEWLINE second person will favor jones in exercise you will show that unconditionally ENDLINE NEWLINE the probability that the second person favors jones is also thus the probability of ENDLINE NEWLINE a success s stays the same from trial to trial however the conditional probability of ENDLINE NEWLINE a success on later trials depends on the number of successes in the previous trials if ENDLINE NEWLINE the population of voters is large removal of one person will not substantially change ENDLINE NEWLINE the fraction of voters favoring jones and the conditional probability that the second ENDLINE NEWLINE person favors jones will be very close to in general if the population is large and ENDLINE NEWLINE the sample size is relatively small the conditional probability of success on a later ENDLINE NEWLINE trial given the number of successes on the previous trials will stay approximately ENDLINE NEWLINE the same regardless of the outcomes on previous trials thus the trials will be ap ENDLINE NEWLINE proximately independent and so sampling problems of this type are approximately ENDLINE NEWLINE binomial ENDLINE NEWLINE if the sample size in example was large relative to the population size say  ENDLINE NEWLINE of the population the conditional probability of selecting a supporter of jones on a ENDLINE NEWLINE later selection would be significantly altered by the preferences of persons selected ENDLINE NEWLINE earlier in the experiment and the experiment would not be binomial the hypergeo ENDLINE NEWLINE metric probability distribution the topic of section is the appropriate probability ENDLINE NEWLINE model to be used when the sample size is large relative to the population size ENDLINE NEWLINE you may wish to refine your ability to identify binomial experiments by reexamin ENDLINE NEWLINE ing the exercises at the end of chapter several of the experiments in those exercises ENDLINE NEWLINE are binomial or approximately binomial experiments ENDLINE NEWLINE the binomial probability distribution py can be derived by applying the sample ENDLINE NEWLINE point approach to find the probability that the experiment yields y successes each ENDLINE NEWLINE sample point in the sample space can be characterized by an n tuple involving the ENDLINE NEWLINE the parameters µ and σ are meaningful numerical descriptive measures that locate ENDLINE NEWLINE the center and describe the spread associated with the values of a random variable ENDLINE NEWLINE y they do not however provide a unique characterization of the distribution of y ENDLINE NEWLINE many different distributions possess the same means and standard deviations we ENDLINE NEWLINE now consider a set of numerical descriptive measures that at least under certain ENDLINE NEWLINE conditions uniquely determine py ENDLINE NEWLINE let us consider however the general idea which ENDLINE NEWLINE most men have respecting what they call luck we ENDLINE NEWLINE shall find that what they regard as affording clear evidence ENDLINE NEWLINE that there is such a thing as luck is in reality ENDLINE NEWLINE the result of law nay they adopt such a combination ENDLINE NEWLINE of ideas about events which seem fortuitous that the ENDLINE NEWLINE kind of evidence they obtain must have been obtained ENDLINE NEWLINE let events fall as they may ENDLINE NEWLINE let us consider the ideas of men about luck inw ENDLINE NEWLINE gambling as typifying in small the ideas of nearly all ENDLINE NEWLINE men about luck in life ENDLINE NEWLINE in the first place gamblers recognise some men as ENDLINE NEWLINE always lucky i do not mean of course that they suppose ENDLINE NEWLINE some men always win but that some men never ENDLINE NEWLINE have spells of bad luck they are in the vein ENDLINE NEWLINE to use the phraseology of gamblers like steinmetz and ENDLINE NEWLINE others who imagine that they have reduced their wild ENDLINE NEWLINE and wandering notions about luck into a science ENDLINE NEWLINE next gamblers recognise those who start on a ENDLINE NEWLINE gambling career with singular good luck retaining that ENDLINE NEWLINE luck long enough to learn to trust in it confidently and ENDLINE NEWLINE then losing it once for all remaining thereafter constantly ENDLINE NEWLINE unlucky ENDLINE NEWLINE thirdly gamblers regard the great bulk of their community ENDLINE NEWLINE as men of varying luck sometimes in the ENDLINE NEWLINE vein sometimes not men who if they are to be ENDLINE NEWLINE successful must according to the superstitions of the ENDLINE NEWLINE gambling world be most careful to watch the progress ENDLINE NEWLINE of events these according to steinmetz the great ENDLINE NEWLINE authority on all such questions may ENDLINE NEWLINE gamble or not according as they are ready or not to ENDLINE NEWLINE obey the dictates of gambling prudence when they ENDLINE NEWLINE are in the vein they should gamble steadily on but so ENDLINE NEWLINE soon as the maturity of the chances brings with it a ENDLINE NEWLINE change of luck they must withdraw if they will not ENDLINE NEWLINE do this they are likely to join the crew of the unlucky ENDLINE NEWLINE fourthly there are those according to the ideas of ENDLINE NEWLINE gamblers who are pursued by constant ill luck they ENDLINE NEWLINE are never in the vein if they win during the first ENDLINE NEWLINE half of an evening they lose more during the latter ENDLINE NEWLINE half but usually they lose all the time ENDLINE NEWLINE fifthly gamblers recognise a class who having begun ENDLINE NEWLINE unfortunately have had a change of luck later and ENDLINE NEWLINE have become members of the lucky fraternity this ENDLINE NEWLINE change they usually ascribe to some action or event ENDLINE NEWLINE which to the less brilliant imaginations of outsiders ENDLINE NEWLINE would seem to have nothing whatever to do with the ENDLINE NEWLINE gamblers luck for instance the luck changed when ENDLINE NEWLINE the man married his wife being a shrew or because ENDLINE NEWLINE he took to wearing white waistcoats or because so and so ENDLINE NEWLINE who had been a sort of evil genius to the unlucky ENDLINE NEWLINE man had gone abroad or died or for some equally preposterous ENDLINE NEWLINE reason ENDLINE NEWLINE then there are special classes of lucky or unlucky ENDLINE NEWLINE men or special peculiarities of luck believed in by ENDLINE NEWLINE individual gamblers but not generally recognised ENDLINE NEWLINE thus there are some who believe that they are lucky on ENDLINE NEWLINE certain days of the week and unlucky on certain other ENDLINE NEWLINE days the skilful whist player who under the name ENDLINE NEWLINE pembridge deplores the rise of the system of signals ENDLINE NEWLINE in whist play believes that he is lucky for a spell of ENDLINE NEWLINE five years unlucky for the next five years and so on ENDLINE NEWLINE continually bulwer lytton believed that he always ENDLINE NEWLINE lost at whist when a certain man was at the same table ENDLINE NEWLINE or in the same room or even in the same house and ENDLINE NEWLINE there are other cases equally absurd ENDLINE NEWLINE now at the outset it is to be remarked that if any ENDLINE NEWLINE large number of persons set to work at any form of ENDLINE NEWLINE gambling card play racing or whatever else it may ENDLINE NEWLINE be their fortunes be such let the individual ENDLINE NEWLINE members of the company be whom they may that they ENDLINE NEWLINE will be divisible into such sets as are indicated above ENDLINE NEWLINE if the numbers are only large enough not one of those ENDLINE NEWLINE classes not even the special classes mentioned at the ENDLINE NEWLINE last can fail to be represented ENDLINE NEWLINE consider for instance the following simple illustrative ENDLINE NEWLINE case ENDLINE NEWLINE suppose a large number of persons say for instance ENDLINE NEWLINE twenty millions engage in some game depending ENDLINE NEWLINE wholly on chance two persons taking part in each ENDLINE NEWLINE game so that there are ten million contests now it is ENDLINE NEWLINE obvious that whether the chances in each contest are ENDLINE NEWLINE exactly equal or not exactly ten millions of the twenty ENDLINE NEWLINE millions of persons will rise up winners and as many ENDLINE NEWLINE will rise up losers the game being understood to be of ENDLINE NEWLINE such a kind that one player or the other must win so ENDLINE NEWLINE far then as the results of that first set of contests are ENDLINE NEWLINE concerned there will be ten million persons who will ENDLINE NEWLINE consider themselves to be in luck ENDLINE NEWLINE now let the same twenty millions of persons engage ENDLINE NEWLINE a second time in the same two handed game the pairs ENDLINE NEWLINE of players being not the same as at the first encounter ENDLINE NEWLINE but distributed as chance may direct then there will ENDLINE NEWLINE be ten millions of winners and ten millions of losers ENDLINE NEWLINE again if we consider the fortunes of the ten million ENDLINE NEWLINE winners on the first night we see that since the chance ENDLINE NEWLINE which each one of these has of being again a winner is ENDLINE NEWLINE equal to the chance he has of losing one half of ENDLINE NEWLINE the winning ten millions of the first night will be winners ENDLINE NEWLINE on the second night too nor shall we deduce a ENDLINE NEWLINE wrong general result if for convenience we say ENDLINE NEWLINE one half so long as we are dealing with very large ENDLINE NEWLINE numbers we know that this result must be near the ENDLINE NEWLINE truth and in chance problems of this sort we require ENDLINE NEWLINE no more on this assumption there ENDLINE NEWLINE are at the end of the second contest five millions who ENDLINE NEWLINE have won in both encounters and five millions who have ENDLINE NEWLINE won in the first and lost in the second the other ten ENDLINE NEWLINE millions who lost in the first encounter may similarly ENDLINE NEWLINE be divided into five millions who lost also in the second ENDLINE NEWLINE and as many who won in the second thus at the end ENDLINE NEWLINE of the second encounter there are five millions of ENDLINE NEWLINE players who deem themselves lucky as they have won ENDLINE NEWLINE twice and not lost at all as many who deem themselves ENDLINE NEWLINE unlucky having lost in both encounters while ten ENDLINE NEWLINE millions or half the original number have no reason ENDLINE NEWLINE to regard themselves as either lucky or unlucky having ENDLINE NEWLINE won and lost in equal degree ENDLINE NEWLINE extending our investigation to a third contest we ENDLINE NEWLINE find that will be confirmed in their opinion ENDLINE NEWLINE that they are very lucky since they will have won in all ENDLINE NEWLINE three encounters while as many will have lost in all ENDLINE NEWLINE three and begin to regard themselves and to be regarded ENDLINE NEWLINE by their fellow gamblers as hopelessly unlucky ENDLINE NEWLINE of the remaining fifteen millions of players it will be ENDLINE NEWLINE found that will have won twice and lost once ENDLINE NEWLINE while as many will have lost twice and won once ENDLINE NEWLINE half of the fifteen millions will deem themselves ENDLINE NEWLINE rather lucky while the other half will deem ENDLINE NEWLINE themselves rather unlucky none of course can have ENDLINE NEWLINE had even luck since an odd number of games has been ENDLINE NEWLINE played ENDLINE NEWLINE our players enter on a fourth series of ENDLINE NEWLINE encounters at its close there are found to be ENDLINE NEWLINE very lucky players who have won in all four encounters ENDLINE NEWLINE and as many unlucky ones who have lost in all four ENDLINE NEWLINE of the players who had won in three encounters ENDLINE NEWLINE one half lose in the fourth they had been ENDLINE NEWLINE deemed lucky but now their luck has changed so ENDLINE NEWLINE with the who had been thus far unlucky ENDLINE NEWLINE one half of them win on the fourth trial we have ENDLINE NEWLINE then winners of three games out of four and ENDLINE NEWLINE losers of three games out of four of the ENDLINE NEWLINE who had won two and lost one one half or ENDLINE NEWLINE win another game and must be added to the ENDLINE NEWLINE just mentioned making three million winners ENDLINE NEWLINE of three games out of four the other half lose the ENDLINE NEWLINE fourth game giving us who have had equal ENDLINE NEWLINE fortunes thus far winning two games and losing two ENDLINE NEWLINE of the other who had lost two and won one ENDLINE NEWLINE half win the fourth game and so give more ENDLINE NEWLINE who have lost two games and won two thus in all we ENDLINE NEWLINE have who have had equal fortunes the ENDLINE NEWLINE others lose at the fourth trial and give us to ENDLINE NEWLINE be added to the already counted who have ENDLINE NEWLINE lost thrice and won once only ENDLINE NEWLINE at the close then of the fourth encounter we find ENDLINE NEWLINE a million and a quarter of players who have been constantly ENDLINE NEWLINE lucky and as many who have been constantly ENDLINE NEWLINE unlucky five millions having won three games out ENDLINE NEWLINE of four consider themselves to have better luck than ENDLINE NEWLINE the average while as many having lost three games ENDLINE NEWLINE out of four regard themselves as unlucky lastly we ENDLINE NEWLINE have seven millions and a half who have won and lost ENDLINE NEWLINE in equal degree these it will be seen constitute the ENDLINE NEWLINE largest part of our gambling community though not ENDLINE NEWLINE equal to the other classes taken together they are in ENDLINE NEWLINE fact three eighths of the entire community ENDLINE NEWLINE so we might proceed to consider the twenty millions ENDLINE NEWLINE of gamblers after a fifth encounter a sixth and so ENDLINE NEWLINE on nor is there any difficulty in dealing with the ENDLINE NEWLINE matter in that way but a sort of account must be ENDLINE NEWLINE kept in proceeding from the various classes considered ENDLINE NEWLINE in dealing with the fourth encounter to those resulting ENDLINE NEWLINE from the fifth from these to those resulting from the ENDLINE NEWLINE sixth and so on and although the accounts thus ENDLINE NEWLINE requiring to be drawn up are easily dealt with the ENDLINE NEWLINE little sums would not present an appearance suited to these pages i ENDLINE NEWLINE therefore now proceed to consider only the results ENDLINE NEWLINE or rather such of the results as bear most upon my ENDLINE NEWLINE subject ENDLINE NEWLINE after the fifth encounter there would be persons who would have won ENDLINE NEWLINE every game they had played and as many who had lost ENDLINE NEWLINE every game these would represent the persistently ENDLINE NEWLINE lucky and unlucky men of our gambling community ENDLINE NEWLINE there would be who having won four times in ENDLINE NEWLINE succession now lost and as many who having lost four ENDLINE NEWLINE times in succession now won these would be the ENDLINE NEWLINE examples of luck good or bad continued to a certain ENDLINE NEWLINE stage and then changing the balance of our ENDLINE NEWLINE amounting to seventeen millions and a half would have ENDLINE NEWLINE had varying degrees of luck from those who had won ENDLINE NEWLINE four games and lost one to those ENDLINE NEWLINE who had lost four games and won ENDLINE NEWLINE but a single game the bulk of the seventeen millions ENDLINE NEWLINE and a half would include those who would have had no ENDLINE NEWLINE reason to regard themselves as either specially lucky or ENDLINE NEWLINE specially unlucky but of them would be ENDLINE NEWLINE regarded as examples of a change of luck being ENDLINE NEWLINE who had won the first three games and lost the remaining ENDLINE NEWLINE two and as many who had lost the first three games ENDLINE NEWLINE and won the last two ENDLINE NEWLINE thus after the fifth game there would be only ENDLINE NEWLINE of those regarded as persistently ENDLINE NEWLINE lucky or unlucky while there would be twice as many who would ENDLINE NEWLINE be regarded by those who knew of their fortunes and ENDLINE NEWLINE of course by themselves as examples of change of luck ENDLINE NEWLINE marked good or bad luck at starting and then bad or ENDLINE NEWLINE good luck ENDLINE NEWLINE so the games would proceed half of the persistently ENDLINE NEWLINE lucky up to a given game going out of that class at the ENDLINE NEWLINE next game to become examples of a change of luck so ENDLINE NEWLINE that the number of the persistently lucky would rapidly ENDLINE NEWLINE diminish as the play continued so would the number ENDLINE NEWLINE of the persistently unlucky continually diminish half ENDLINE NEWLINE going out at each new encounter to join the ranks of ENDLINE NEWLINE those who had long been unlucky but had at last experienced ENDLINE NEWLINE a change of fortune ENDLINE NEWLINE after the twentieth game if we suppose constant ENDLINE NEWLINE exact halving to take place as far as possible and then ENDLINE NEWLINE to be followed by halving as near as possible there ENDLINE NEWLINE would be about a score who had won every game of the ENDLINE NEWLINE twenty no amount of reasoning would persuade these ENDLINE NEWLINE players or those who had heard of their fortunes that ENDLINE NEWLINE they were not exceedingly lucky persons not in the ENDLINE NEWLINE sense of being lucky because they won but of ENDLINE NEWLINE being at any time than any of those who ENDLINE NEWLINE had taken part in the twenty games they themselves ENDLINE NEWLINE and their friends ay and their enemies too would ENDLINE NEWLINE conclude that they not lose in like manner ENDLINE NEWLINE the score or so who had not won a single game out of ENDLINE NEWLINE the twenty would be judged to be most unlucky persons ENDLINE NEWLINE whom it would be madness to back in any matter of ENDLINE NEWLINE pure chance ENDLINE NEWLINE yet to pause for a moment on the case of these ENDLINE NEWLINE apparently most manifest examples of persistent luck the ENDLINE NEWLINE result we have obtained has been to show that ENDLINE NEWLINE inevitably there must be in a given number of trials ENDLINE NEWLINE about a score of these cases of persistent luck good or ENDLINE NEWLINE bad and about two score of cases where both good and ENDLINE NEWLINE bad are counted together we have shown that without ENDLINE NEWLINE imagining any antecedent luckiness good or bad there ENDLINE NEWLINE must be what to the players themselves and to all who ENDLINE NEWLINE heard of or saw what had happened to them would ENDLINE NEWLINE seem examples of the most marvellous luck supposing ENDLINE NEWLINE as we have that the game is one of pure chance so that ENDLINE NEWLINE skill cannot influence it and cheating is wholly prevented ENDLINE NEWLINE all betting men would be disposed to say these ENDLINE NEWLINE twenty are persons whose good luck can be depended ENDLINE NEWLINE on we must certainly back them for the next game ENDLINE NEWLINE and those other twenty are hopelessly unlucky we may ENDLINE NEWLINE lay almost any odds against their winning ENDLINE NEWLINE but it should hardly be necessary to say that that ENDLINE NEWLINE which happen cannot be regarded as due to luck ENDLINE NEWLINE there must be set of twenty or so out of our twenty ENDLINE NEWLINE millions who will win every game of twenty and the ENDLINE NEWLINE circumstance that this has befallen such and such persons ENDLINE NEWLINE no more means that they are lucky and is no more ENDLINE NEWLINE a matter to be marvelled at than the circumstance that ENDLINE NEWLINE one person has drawn the prize ticket out of twenty ENDLINE NEWLINE at a lottery is marvellous or signifies that he would be ENDLINE NEWLINE always lucky in lottery drawing ENDLINE NEWLINE the question whether those twenty persons who ENDLINE NEWLINE had so far been persistently lucky would be better ENDLINE NEWLINE worth backing than the rest of the twenty millions ENDLINE NEWLINE and especially than the other twenty who had persistently ENDLINE NEWLINE lost would in reality be disposed of at the ENDLINE NEWLINE twenty first trial in a very decisive way for of the ENDLINE NEWLINE former score about half would lose while of the latter ENDLINE NEWLINE score about half would win among a thousand persons ENDLINE NEWLINE who had backed the former set at odds there would ENDLINE NEWLINE be a heavy average of loss and the like among a thousand ENDLINE NEWLINE persons who had laid against the latter set at ENDLINE NEWLINE odds ENDLINE NEWLINE it may be said this is assertion only that experience ENDLINE NEWLINE shows that some men are lucky and others unlucky at ENDLINE NEWLINE games or other matters depending purely on chance ENDLINE NEWLINE and it must be safer to back the former and to wager ENDLINE NEWLINE against the latter the answer is that the matter has ENDLINE NEWLINE been tested over and over again by experience with the ENDLINE NEWLINE result that as reasoning had shown some men ENDLINE NEWLINE are bound to be fortunate again and again in any ENDLINE NEWLINE great number of trials but that these are no more likely ENDLINE NEWLINE to be fortunate on fresh trials than others including ENDLINE NEWLINE those who have been most unfortunate ENDLINE NEWLINE an objection will about here have vaguely presented ENDLINE NEWLINE itself to believers in luck viz come off greatly to the gratification ENDLINE NEWLINE of believers in luck in one case they could say ENDLINE NEWLINE i told you so such luck as as was bound to pull him ENDLINE NEWLINE through again in the other i told you so such luck ENDLINE NEWLINE was bound to change or if it were the loser of twenty ENDLINE NEWLINE trials who was in question then i told you so he was ENDLINE NEWLINE bound to win at last or i told you so such an unlucky ENDLINE NEWLINE fellow was bound to lose but unfortunately ENDLINE NEWLINE though the believers in luck thus run with the hare and ENDLINE NEWLINE hunt with the hounds though they are prepared to find ENDLINE NEWLINE any and every event confirming their notions about luck ENDLINE NEWLINE yet when a score of trials or so are made as in our supposed ENDLINE NEWLINE case of a twenty first game the chances are that ENDLINE NEWLINE they would be contradicted by the event the twenty ENDLINE NEWLINE constant winners would not be more lucky than the ENDLINE NEWLINE twenty constant losers but neither would they be less ENDLINE NEWLINE lucky the chances are that about half would win and ENDLINE NEWLINE about half would lose if one who really understands ENDLINE NEWLINE the laws of probability could be supposed foolish enough ENDLINE NEWLINE to wager money on either twenty or on both he ENDLINE NEWLINE would unquestionably regard the betting as perfectly ENDLINE NEWLINE even ENDLINE NEWLINE let us return to the rest of our twenty millions of ENDLINE NEWLINE players though we need by no means consider all the ENDLINE NEWLINE various classes into which they may be divided for the ENDLINE NEWLINE number of these classes amounts in fact to more than ENDLINE NEWLINE a million ENDLINE NEWLINE the great bulk of the twenty millions would consist ENDLINE NEWLINE of players who had won about as many games as they ENDLINE NEWLINE had lost the number who had won as many ENDLINE NEWLINE games as they had lost would no longer form a large ENDLINE NEWLINE proportion of the total though it would form the largest ENDLINE NEWLINE individual class there would be nearly of ENDLINE NEWLINE these while there would be about who had ENDLINE NEWLINE won eleven and lost nine and as many who had won ENDLINE NEWLINE nine and lost eleven these two classes together would ENDLINE NEWLINE outnumber the winners of ten games exactly in the ENDLINE NEWLINE proportion of to or thereabouts speaking generally ENDLINE NEWLINE it may be said that about two thirds of the community ENDLINE NEWLINE would consider they had had neither good luck nor ENDLINE NEWLINE bad though their opinion would depend on temperament ENDLINE NEWLINE in part for some men are more sensitive to losses than ENDLINE NEWLINE to gains and are ready to speak of themselves as unlucky ENDLINE NEWLINE when a careful examination of their varying fortunes ENDLINE NEWLINE shows that they have neither won nor lost on the whole ENDLINE NEWLINE or have won rather more than they have lost on the ENDLINE NEWLINE other hand there are some who are more exhilarated by ENDLINE NEWLINE success than dashed by failure ENDLINE NEWLINE the number of those who having begun with good ENDLINE NEWLINE luck had eventually been so markedly unfortunate ENDLINE NEWLINE would be considerable it might be taken to include ENDLINE NEWLINE all who had won the first six games and lost all the rest ENDLINE NEWLINE or who had won the first seven or the first eight or any ENDLINE NEWLINE number up to say the first fourteen losing thence to ENDLINE NEWLINE the end and so estimated would amount to about ENDLINE NEWLINE an equal number being first markedly unfortunate and ENDLINE NEWLINE then constantly fortunate but the number who had ENDLINE NEWLINE experienced a marked change of luck would be much ENDLINE NEWLINE greater if it were taken to include all who had ENDLINE NEWLINE won a large proportion of the first nine or ten games ENDLINE NEWLINE and lost a large proportion of the remainder or ENDLINE NEWLINE these two classes of players would ENDLINE NEWLINE be well represented ENDLINE NEWLINE thus then we see that setting enough persons ENDLINE NEWLINE playing at any game of pure chance and assuming ENDLINE NEWLINE only that among any large number of players there ENDLINE NEWLINE will be about as many winners as losers irrespective of ENDLINE NEWLINE luck good or bad all the five classes which gambling ENDLINE NEWLINE folk recognise and regard as proving the existence of ENDLINE NEWLINE luck must inevitably make their appearance ENDLINE NEWLINE even any special class which some believer in luck ENDLINE NEWLINE who was more or less fanciful imagined he had recognised ENDLINE NEWLINE among gambling folk must inevitably appear ENDLINE NEWLINE among our twenty millions of illustrative players for ENDLINE NEWLINE example there would be about a score of players who ENDLINE NEWLINE would have won the first game lost the second won ENDLINE NEWLINE the third and so on alternately to the end and as ENDLINE NEWLINE many who had also won and lost alternate games but ENDLINE NEWLINE had lost the first game some forty therefore whose ENDLINE NEWLINE fortune it seemed to be to win only after they had lost ENDLINE NEWLINE and to lose only after they had won again about ENDLINE NEWLINE twenty would win the first five games lose the next ENDLINE NEWLINE five win the third five and lose the last five and ENDLINE NEWLINE about twenty more would lose the first five win the ENDLINE NEWLINE next lose the third five and win the last five about ENDLINE NEWLINE forty players therefore who seemed bound to win and ENDLINE NEWLINE lose always five games and no more in succession ENDLINE NEWLINE again if anyone had made a prediction that among ENDLINE NEWLINE the players of the twenty games there would be one ENDLINE NEWLINE who would win the first then lose two then win three ENDLINE NEWLINE then lose four then win five and then lose the remaining ENDLINE NEWLINE five and yet a sixth if the twenty first game were ENDLINE NEWLINE played that prophet would certainly be justified by ENDLINE NEWLINE the result for about a score would be sure to have ENDLINE NEWLINE just such fortunes as he had indicated up to the ENDLINE NEWLINE twentieth game and of these nine or ten would be ENDLINE NEWLINE sure to win the twenty first game also ENDLINE NEWLINE we see then that all the different kinds of luck good ENDLINE NEWLINE bad indifferent or changing which believers in ENDLINE NEWLINE luck recognise are bound to appear when any considerable ENDLINE NEWLINE number of trials are made and all the varied ENDLINE NEWLINE ideas which men have formed respecting fortune and ENDLINE NEWLINE her ways are bound to be confirmed ENDLINE NEWLINE it may be asked by some whether this is not proving ENDLINE NEWLINE that there is such a thing as luck instead of over throwing ENDLINE NEWLINE the idea of luck but such a question can ENDLINE NEWLINE only arise from a confusion of ideas as to what is meant ENDLINE NEWLINE by luck if it be merely asserted that such and such ENDLINE NEWLINE men have been lucky or unlucky no one need dispute ENDLINE NEWLINE the proposition for among the millions of millions of ENDLINE NEWLINE millions of purely fortuitous events affecting the millions ENDLINE NEWLINE of persons now living it could not but chance that ENDLINE NEWLINE the most remarkable combinations sequences alternations ENDLINE NEWLINE and so forth of events lucky or unlucky must ENDLINE NEWLINE have presented themselves in the careers of hundreds ENDLINE NEWLINE our illustrative case artificial though it may seem is ENDLINE NEWLINE in reality not merely an illustration of life and its ENDLINE NEWLINE chances but may be regarded as legitimately demonstrating ENDLINE NEWLINE what must inevitably happen on the wider ENDLINE NEWLINE arena and amid the infinitely multiplied vicissitudes of ENDLINE NEWLINE life but the belief in luck involves much more the ENDLINE NEWLINE idea involved in it if not openly expressed is that some men are lucky by ENDLINE NEWLINE nature others unlucky that such and such times and ENDLINE NEWLINE seasons are lucky or unlucky that the progress of ENDLINE NEWLINE events may be modified by the lucky or unlucky influence ENDLINE NEWLINE of actions in no way relating to them as for ENDLINE NEWLINE instance that success or failure at cards may be affected ENDLINE NEWLINE by the choice of a seat or by turning round thrice in ENDLINE NEWLINE the seat this form of belief in luck is not only akin ENDLINE NEWLINE to superstition it superstition like all superstition ENDLINE NEWLINE it is mischievous it is indeed the very essence of the ENDLINE NEWLINE gambling spirit a spirit so demoralising that it blinds ENDLINE NEWLINE men to the innate immorality of gambling it is this ENDLINE NEWLINE belief in luck as something which can be relied on or ENDLINE NEWLINE propitiated or influenced by such and such practices ENDLINE NEWLINE which is shown by reasoning and experience alike to ENDLINE NEWLINE be entirely inconsistent not only with facts but with ENDLINE NEWLINE possibility ENDLINE NEWLINE but oddly enough the believers in luck show by ENDLINE NEWLINE the form which their belief takes that in reality they ENDLINE NEWLINE have no faith in luck any more than men really have ENDLINE NEWLINE faith in superstitions which yet they allow to influence ENDLINE NEWLINE their conduct a superstition is an idle dread or an ENDLINE NEWLINE equally idle hope not a real faith and in like manner ENDLINE NEWLINE is it with luck a man will tell you that at cards for ENDLINE NEWLINE instance he always has such and such luck but if you ENDLINE NEWLINE say let us have a few games to see whether you will ENDLINE NEWLINE have your usual luck you will usually find him unwilling ENDLINE NEWLINE to let you apply the test if you try it and ENDLINE NEWLINE the result is unfavourable he argues that such peculiarities ENDLINE NEWLINE of luck never do show themselves when submitted ENDLINE NEWLINE to test on the other hand if it so chances ENDLINE NEWLINE that on that particular occasion he has the kind of ENDLINE NEWLINE luck which he claims to have he expects you ENDLINE NEWLINE to accept the evidence as decisive yet the result ENDLINE NEWLINE means in reality only that certain events the chances ENDLINE NEWLINE for and against which were probably pretty equally ENDLINE NEWLINE divided have taken place ENDLINE NEWLINE so if a gambler has the notion that turning round thrice in his ENDLINE NEWLINE chair will change the luck he is by no means corrected ENDLINE NEWLINE of the superstition by finding the process fail on any ENDLINE NEWLINE particular occasion but if the bad luck which has ENDLINE NEWLINE hitherto pursued him chances to be replaced by good or even by ENDLINE NEWLINE moderate luck after the gambler has gone through the ENDLINE NEWLINE mystic process described or some other equally absurd ENDLINE NEWLINE and irrelevant manuvre then the superstition is confirmed ENDLINE NEWLINE yet all the time there is no real faith in it ENDLINE NEWLINE such practices are like the absurd invocation of indian ENDLINE NEWLINE medicine men there is a sort of vague hope that ENDLINE NEWLINE something good may come of them no real faith in ENDLINE NEWLINE their efficacy ENDLINE NEWLINE the best proof of the utter absence of real faith in ENDLINE NEWLINE superstitions about luck even among gambling men ENDLINE NEWLINE the most superstitious of mankind may be found in the ENDLINE NEWLINE incongruity of their two leading ideas if there are ENDLINE NEWLINE two forms of expression more frequently than any ENDLINE NEWLINE others in the mouth of gambling men they are those ENDLINE NEWLINE which relate to being in luck or out of luck on the one ENDLINE NEWLINE hand and to the idea that luck must change on the ENDLINE NEWLINE other professional gamblers like steinmetz and his ENDLINE NEWLINE kind have become so satisfied that these ideas are ENDLINE NEWLINE sound whatever else may be unsound in regard to ENDLINE NEWLINE luck that they have invented technical expressions to ENDLINE NEWLINE present these theories of theirs failing utterly to notice ENDLINE NEWLINE that the ideas are inconsistent with each other and ENDLINE NEWLINE cannot both be right though both may be wrong and ENDLINE NEWLINE are so ENDLINE NEWLINE a player is said to be in the vein when he has ENDLINE NEWLINE for some time been fortunate he should only go on ENDLINE NEWLINE playing if he is wise at such a time and at such a ENDLINE NEWLINE time only should he be backed having been lucky he ENDLINE NEWLINE is likely according to this notion to continue lucky ENDLINE NEWLINE but on the other hand the theory called the maturity ENDLINE NEWLINE of the chances teaches that the luck cannot continue ENDLINE NEWLINE more than a certain time in one direction when it has ENDLINE NEWLINE reached maturity in that direction it must change ENDLINE NEWLINE therefore when a man has been in the vein for a ENDLINE NEWLINE certain time it is unsafe to back him for he must ENDLINE NEWLINE be on the verge of a change of luck ENDLINE NEWLINE of course the gambler is confirmed in his superstition ENDLINE NEWLINE whichever event may befall in such cases when ENDLINE NEWLINE he wins he applauds himself for following the luck or ENDLINE NEWLINE for duly anticipating a change of luck as the case may ENDLINE NEWLINE be when he loses he simply regrets his folly in not ENDLINE NEWLINE seeing that the luck must change or in not standing ENDLINE NEWLINE by the winner ENDLINE NEWLINE and with regard to the idea that luck must change ENDLINE NEWLINE and that in the long run events must run even it is ENDLINE NEWLINE noteworthy how few gambling men recognise either on ENDLINE NEWLINE the one hand how inconsistent this idea is with their ENDLINE NEWLINE belief in luck which may be trusted or on the other hand the real ENDLINE NEWLINE way in which luck comes even after a sufficiently ENDLINE NEWLINE long run ENDLINE NEWLINE a man who has played long with success goes on ENDLINE NEWLINE because he regards himself as lucky a man who has ENDLINE NEWLINE played long without success goes on because he considers ENDLINE NEWLINE that the luck is bound to change the latter goes on ENDLINE NEWLINE with the idea that if he only plays long enough he ENDLINE NEWLINE must at least at some time or other recover his losses ENDLINE NEWLINE now there can be no manner of doubt that if a man ENDLINE NEWLINE possessed of sufficient means goes on playing for a very ENDLINE NEWLINE long time his gains and losses will eventually be very ENDLINE NEWLINE nearly equal assuming always of course that he is not ENDLINE NEWLINE swindled which as we are dealing with gambling ENDLINE NEWLINE men is perhaps a sufficiently bold assumption yet it ENDLINE NEWLINE by no means follows that if he starts with considerable ENDLINE NEWLINE losses he will ever recover the sum he has thus had to ENDLINE NEWLINE part with or that his losses may not be considerably ENDLINE NEWLINE increased this sounds like a paradox but in reality ENDLINE NEWLINE the real paradox lies in the opposite view ENDLINE NEWLINE this may be readily shown ENDLINE NEWLINE the idea to be controverted is this that if a gambler ENDLINE NEWLINE plays long enough there must come a time when ENDLINE NEWLINE his gains and his losses are exactly balanced of ENDLINE NEWLINE course if this were true it would be a very strong ENDLINE NEWLINE argument against gambling for what but loss of time ENDLINE NEWLINE can be the result of following a course which must ENDLINE NEWLINE inevitably lead you if you go on long enough to the ENDLINE NEWLINE place from which you started but it is not true if ENDLINE NEWLINE it were true of course it involves the inference that no ENDLINE NEWLINE matter when you enter on a course of gambling you ENDLINE NEWLINE are bound after a certain time to find yourself where ENDLINE NEWLINE you were at that beginning it follows that if you lose considerably in the first ENDLINE NEWLINE few weeks or months of your gambling career then if ENDLINE NEWLINE you only play long enough you must inevitably find ENDLINE NEWLINE yourself as great a loser on the whole as you were when ENDLINE NEWLINE you were thus in arrears through gambling losses for ENDLINE NEWLINE your play may be quite as properly considered to have ENDLINE NEWLINE begun when those losses had just been incurred as to ENDLINE NEWLINE have begun at any other time hence this idea that ENDLINE NEWLINE in the long run the luck must run even involves the ENDLINE NEWLINE conclusion that if you are a loser or a gainer in the ENDLINE NEWLINE beginning of your play you must at some time or other ENDLINE NEWLINE be equally a gainer or loser this is manifestly inconsistent ENDLINE NEWLINE with the idea that long continued play will ENDLINE NEWLINE inevitably leave you neither a loser nor a gainer if ENDLINE NEWLINE starting from a certain point when you are a thousand ENDLINE NEWLINE pounds in arrears you are certain some time or other ENDLINE NEWLINE if you only play long enough to have gained back that ENDLINE NEWLINE thousand pounds it is obvious that you are equally ENDLINE NEWLINE certain some time or other ENDLINE NEWLINE to be yet another thousand pounds in arrears ENDLINE NEWLINE for there is no line of argument to prove you must ENDLINE NEWLINE regain it which will not equally prove that some time ENDLINE NEWLINE or other you must be a loser by that same amount over ENDLINE NEWLINE and above what you had already lost when beginning ENDLINE NEWLINE the games which were to put you right if then you ENDLINE NEWLINE are to come straight you must be able certainly to ENDLINE NEWLINE recover two thousand pounds and by parity of reasoning ENDLINE NEWLINE four thousand and again twice that and so on ENDLINE NEWLINE which is manifestly absurd ENDLINE NEWLINE the real fact is that while the laws of probabilities ENDLINE NEWLINE do undoubtedly assure the gambler that his losses and ENDLINE NEWLINE gains will in the long run be nearly equal the kind of ENDLINE NEWLINE equality thus approached is not an equality of actual ENDLINE NEWLINE amount but of proportion if two men keep on tossing ENDLINE NEWLINE for sovereigns it becomes more and more unlikely ENDLINE NEWLINE the longer they toss that the difference between them ENDLINE NEWLINE will fall short of any given sum if they go on till ENDLINE NEWLINE they have tossed twenty million times the odds are ENDLINE NEWLINE heavily in favour of one or the other being a loser of at ENDLINE NEWLINE least a thousand pounds but the proportion of the ENDLINE NEWLINE amount won by one altogether to the amount won altogether ENDLINE NEWLINE by the other is almost certain to be very nearly ENDLINE NEWLINE a proportion of equality suppose for example that at ENDLINE NEWLINE the end of twenty millions of tossings one player is a ENDLINE NEWLINE winner of then he must have won in all ENDLINE NEWLINE the other having won in all ENDLINE NEWLINE the ratio of these amounts is that of to ENDLINE NEWLINE or to this is very nearly the ratio of ENDLINE NEWLINE to or is scarcely distinguishable practically ENDLINE NEWLINE from actual equality now if these men had only ENDLINE NEWLINE tossed eight times for sovereigns it might very well ENDLINE NEWLINE have happened that one would have won five or six ENDLINE NEWLINE times while the other had only won thrice or twice ENDLINE NEWLINE yet with a ratio of to or to against the loser ENDLINE NEWLINE he would actually be out of pocket only in one case ENDLINE NEWLINE and in the other while in the other case with a ENDLINE NEWLINE ratio of almost perfect equality he would be the loser ENDLINE NEWLINE of a thousand pounds ENDLINE NEWLINE but now it might appear that after all this is ENDLINE NEWLINE proving too much or at any rate proves as much on ENDLINE NEWLINE one side as on the other for if one player loses the ENDLINE NEWLINE other must gain if a certain set of players lose the ENDLINE NEWLINE rest gain and it might seem as though with the prevalent ENDLINE NEWLINE ideas of many respecting gambling games the ENDLINE NEWLINE chance of winning were a sufficient compensation for ENDLINE NEWLINE the chance of losing ENDLINE NEWLINE where a man is so foolish that the chance of having ENDLINE NEWLINE more money than he wants is equivalent in his mind ENDLINE NEWLINE to the risk of being ENDLINE NEWLINE deprived of the power of getting what is necessary for ENDLINE NEWLINE himself and for his family such reasoning may be ENDLINE NEWLINE regarded as convincing for those who weigh their ENDLINE NEWLINE wants and wishes rightly it has no value whatever ENDLINE NEWLINE on the contrary it may be shown that every wager or ENDLINE NEWLINE gambling transaction by a man of moderate means ENDLINE NEWLINE definitely reduces the actual value of his possessions ENDLINE NEWLINE even if the wager or transaction be a fair one if a ENDLINE NEWLINE man who has a hundred pounds available to meet his ENDLINE NEWLINE present wants wagers against or an equal ENDLINE NEWLINE chance he is no longer worth he when ENDLINE NEWLINE the bet is decided be worth or he may be worth ENDLINE NEWLINE only all he can his property at is about ENDLINE NEWLINE supposing the other man to be in the same position ENDLINE NEWLINE they are both impoverished as soon as they have ENDLINE NEWLINE made the bet and when the wager is decided the ENDLINE NEWLINE average value of their possessions in ready money is less ENDLINE NEWLINE than it was for the winner gains less by having his ENDLINE NEWLINE raised to than the ENDLINE NEWLINE loser suffers by having his ready money halved ENDLINE NEWLINE similar remarks apply to participation in lottery ENDLINE NEWLINE schemes or the various forms of gambling at places ENDLINE NEWLINE like san carlo every sum wagered means at the ENDLINE NEWLINE moment when it is staked a depreciation of the gamblers ENDLINE NEWLINE property and would mean that even if the terms ENDLINE NEWLINE on which the wagering were conducted were strictly fair ENDLINE NEWLINE but this is never the case in all lotteries and in all ENDLINE NEWLINE established systems of gambling certain odds are always ENDLINE NEWLINE retained in favour of those who work the lottery or ENDLINE NEWLINE the gambling system these odds make gambling in ENDLINE NEWLINE either form still more injurious to those who take part ENDLINE NEWLINE in it winners of course there are and in some few ENDLINE NEWLINE cases winners may retain a large part of their gains or ENDLINE NEWLINE at any rate expend them otherwise than in fresh gambling ENDLINE NEWLINE yet it is manifest that apart from the circumstance ENDLINE NEWLINE that the of the gambling gains of one set ENDLINE NEWLINE of persons never counterbalance the of the gambling ENDLINE NEWLINE losses of others there is always a large deduction ENDLINE NEWLINE to be made on account of the wild and reckless waste ENDLINE NEWLINE of money won by gambling in many cases indeed ENDLINE NEWLINE large gambling gains have brought ruin to the unfortunate ENDLINE NEWLINE winner set on horseback by lightly acquired ENDLINE NEWLINE wealth and unaccustomed to the position he has ridden ENDLINE NEWLINE straightway to the devil ENDLINE NEWLINE but the greed for chance won wealth is so great ENDLINE NEWLINE among men of weak minds and they are so large a ENDLINE NEWLINE majority of all communities that the bait may be ENDLINE NEWLINE dangled for them without care to conceal the hook in ENDLINE NEWLINE all lotteries and gambling systems which have yet been ENDLINE NEWLINE known the hook has been patent and the evil it must ENDLINE NEWLINE do if swallowed should have been obvious yet it has ENDLINE NEWLINE been swallowed greedily ENDLINE NEWLINE a most remarkable illustration of the folly of those ENDLINE NEWLINE who trust in luck and the cool audacity of those who ENDLINE NEWLINE trust in such folly with more reason but with more ENDLINE NEWLINE rascality is presented by the louisiana lottery in ENDLINE NEWLINE america this is the only lottery of the kind now ENDLINE NEWLINE permitted in america indeed it is nominally restricted ENDLINE NEWLINE to the state of louisiana but practically the whole ENDLINE NEWLINE country takes part in it tickets being obtainable by ENDLINE NEWLINE residents in every state of the union the peculiarity ENDLINE NEWLINE of the lottery is the ENDLINE NEWLINE advertisements announce that each month ENDLINE NEWLINE tickets will be sold each at five dollars shares of one fifth ENDLINE NEWLINE being purchasable at one dollar two commissioners generals ENDLINE NEWLINE early and beauregard control the ENDLINE NEWLINE drawings so that we are told and may well believe ENDLINE NEWLINE the drawings are conducted with fairness and honesty ENDLINE NEWLINE and in good faith to all parties so far all is well we ENDLINE NEWLINE see that each month if all the tickets are sold the sum ENDLINE NEWLINE of dols and taking the sum of thus collected were to ENDLINE NEWLINE say the lottery gentlemen gamblers will now proceed ENDLINE NEWLINE of the sum before me i will distribute in ENDLINE NEWLINE prizes as followsthe rest this sum of ENDLINE NEWLINE which i have here separated i will put into my own ENDLINE NEWLINE pocket for my trouble ENDLINE NEWLINE in getting up this lottery the louisiana lottery is ENDLINE NEWLINE a transaction of the same rascally type not rendered ENDLINE NEWLINE more respectable by being on a very much larger scale ENDLINE NEWLINE if the spirit of rash speculation will let men submit ENDLINE NEWLINE to swindling so gross as this we can scarcely see any ENDLINE NEWLINE limit to its operation yet hundreds of thousands yield ENDLINE NEWLINE to the temptation thus offered to gain suddenly a large ENDLINE NEWLINE sum at the expense of a small sum almost certainly lost ENDLINE NEWLINE and partly stolen ENDLINE NEWLINE it should be known though perhaps even this ENDLINE NEWLINE knowledge would not keep the moths away from the ENDLINE NEWLINE destruction to which they seem irresistibly lured that ENDLINE NEWLINE gambling carried on long enough is not probable but ENDLINE NEWLINE certain ruin there is no sum however large which is ENDLINE NEWLINE not certain to be absorbed at some time in the continuance ENDLINE NEWLINE of a sufficiently long series of trials even at fair ENDLINE NEWLINE risks gamblers with moderate fortunes overlook this ENDLINE NEWLINE in their idea mistaken as it is that luck must run even ENDLINE NEWLINE at last they forget that before that last to which they ENDLINE NEWLINE look has been reached their last shilling may have ENDLINE NEWLINE gone if they were content even to stay till possibly gain ENDLINE NEWLINE balanced loss there would be some chance of escape ENDLINE NEWLINE but what real gambler ever was content with such an ENDLINE NEWLINE aim as that luck must not only turn till loss has ENDLINE NEWLINE been recouped but run on till great gains have been ENDLINE NEWLINE made and no gambler was ever yet content to stay ENDLINE NEWLINE his hand when winning or to give up when he began ENDLINE NEWLINE to lose again the fatal faith in eventual good luck is ENDLINE NEWLINE the source of all bad luck it is in itself the worst luck ENDLINE NEWLINE of all every gambler has this faith and no gambler ENDLINE NEWLINE who holds to it is likely long to escape ruin ENDLINE NEWLINE it might be supposed that those who are most familiar ENDLINE NEWLINE with the actual results which present themselves in long ENDLINE NEWLINE series of chance games would form the most correct ENDLINE NEWLINE views respecting the conditions on which such results ENDLINE NEWLINE depend would be in fact freest from all superstitious ENDLINE NEWLINE ideas respecting chance or luck the gambler who ENDLINE NEWLINE sees every system his own infallible system included foiled ENDLINE NEWLINE by the run of events who witnesses the discomfiture ENDLINE NEWLINE of one gamester after another that for a time ENDLINE NEWLINE had seemed irresistibly lucky and who can number by ENDLINE NEWLINE hundreds those who have been ruined by the love of ENDLINE NEWLINE play might be expected to recognise the futility of all ENDLINE NEWLINE attempts to anticipate the results of chance combinations ENDLINE NEWLINE it is however but too well known that the ENDLINE NEWLINE reverse is the case the more familiar a man becomes ENDLINE NEWLINE with the multitude of such combinations the more ENDLINE NEWLINE confidently he believes in the possibility of foretelling not ENDLINE NEWLINE indeed any special event but the general run ENDLINE NEWLINE of several approaching events there has never been a ENDLINE NEWLINE successful gambler who has not believed that his success ENDLINE NEWLINE has been the result of ENDLINE NEWLINE skilful conduct on his own part and there has never been ENDLINE NEWLINE a ruined gambler who has not believed that when ENDLINE NEWLINE ruin overtook him he was on the very point of mastering ENDLINE NEWLINE the secret of success it is this fatal confidence which ENDLINE NEWLINE gives to gambling its power of fascinating the lucky as ENDLINE NEWLINE well as the unlucky the winner continues to tempt ENDLINE NEWLINE fortune believing all the while that he is exerting ENDLINE NEWLINE some special aptitude for games of chance until the ENDLINE NEWLINE inevitable change of luck arrives and thereafter he ENDLINE NEWLINE continues to play because he believes that his luck has ENDLINE NEWLINE only deserted him for a time and must presently return ENDLINE NEWLINE the unlucky gambler on the contrary regards his ENDLINE NEWLINE losses as sacrifices to ensure the ultimate success of his ENDLINE NEWLINE system and even when he has lost his all continues ENDLINE NEWLINE firm in the belief that had he had more money to ENDLINE NEWLINE sacrifice he could have bound fortune to his side for ENDLINE NEWLINE ever ENDLINE NEWLINE i propose to consider some of the most common ENDLINE NEWLINE gambling superstitions noting at the same time that ENDLINE NEWLINE like superstitions prevail respecting chance events even among those who never ENDLINE NEWLINE gamble ENDLINE NEWLINE houdin in his interesting book voil has given some amusing instances of ENDLINE NEWLINE the fruits of long gaming experience they are presented ENDLINE NEWLINE says steinmetz from whose work i quote them as the axioms of a professional ENDLINE NEWLINE gambler and cheat thus we might expect that ENDLINE NEWLINE however unsatisfactory to men of honest mind they ENDLINE NEWLINE would at least savour of a certain sort of wisdom yet ENDLINE NEWLINE these axioms the fruit of long study directed by self interest ENDLINE NEWLINE are all utterly untrustworthy ENDLINE NEWLINE every game of chance says this authority presents ENDLINE NEWLINE two kinds of chances that are very distinct namely ENDLINE NEWLINE those relating to the person interested that is ENDLINE NEWLINE the player and those inherent in the combinations of ENDLINE NEWLINE the game that is we are to distinguish between the ENDLINE NEWLINE chances proper to the game and those depending on the ENDLINE NEWLINE luck of the player proceeding to consider the chances ENDLINE NEWLINE proper to the game itself our friendly cheat sums them ENDLINE NEWLINE all up in two rules first though chance can bring ENDLINE NEWLINE into the game all possible combinations there are nevertheless ENDLINE NEWLINE certain limits at which it seems to stop such ENDLINE NEWLINE for instance as a certain number turning up ten times ENDLINE NEWLINE in succession at roulette this is possible but it has ENDLINE NEWLINE never happened secondly in a game of chance the ENDLINE NEWLINE oftener the same combination has occurred in succession ENDLINE NEWLINE the nearer we are to the certainty that it will not ENDLINE NEWLINE recur at the next cast or turn up this is the most ENDLINE NEWLINE elementary of the theories on probabilities it is termed ENDLINE NEWLINE hence he proceeds a player must ENDLINE NEWLINE come to the table not only in luck but he must not ENDLINE NEWLINE risk his money except at the instant prescribed by the ENDLINE NEWLINE rules of the maturity of the chances then follow the ENDLINE NEWLINE precepts for personal conduct for gaming prefer ENDLINE NEWLINE roulette because it presents several ways of staking ENDLINE NEWLINE your money which permits the study of several a ENDLINE NEWLINE player should approach the gaming table perfectly calm ENDLINE NEWLINE and cool just as a merchant or tradesman in treaty ENDLINE NEWLINE about any affair if he gets into a passion it is all ENDLINE NEWLINE over with prudence all over with good luck for the ENDLINE NEWLINE demon of bad luck invariably pursues a passionate ENDLINE NEWLINE player every man who finds a pleasure in playing ENDLINE NEWLINE runs the risk of losing admission would appear as we shall presently see ENDLINE NEWLINE to have been the fruit of genuine experience on our gamblers part ENDLINE NEWLINE it only requires that for the words runs the risk we should read ENDLINE NEWLINE incurs the certainty to be incontrovertible ENDLINE NEWLINE a prudent player before ENDLINE NEWLINE undertaking anything should put himself to the test to ENDLINE NEWLINE discover if he is in vein or in luck in all doubt ENDLINE NEWLINE he should abstain there are several persons who are ENDLINE NEWLINE constantly pursued by bad luck to such i saystubbornness at play is ruin remember that ENDLINE NEWLINE fortune does not like people to be overjoyed at her ENDLINE NEWLINE favours and that she prepares bitter deceptions for the ENDLINE NEWLINE imprudent who are intoxicated by success lastly ENDLINE NEWLINE before risking your money at play study your vein ENDLINE NEWLINE and the different probabilities of the game termed as ENDLINE NEWLINE aforesaid the maturity of the chances ENDLINE NEWLINE before proceeding to exhibit the fallacy of the principles ENDLINE NEWLINE here enunciated principles which have worked ENDLINE NEWLINE incalculable mischief it may be well to sketch the ENDLINE NEWLINE history of the scamp who enunciated them so far at ENDLINE NEWLINE least as his gambling successes are concerned his ENDLINE NEWLINE first meeting with houdin took place at a subscription ENDLINE NEWLINE ball where he managed to fleece houdin and ENDLINE NEWLINE others to a considerable amount contriving a dexterous ENDLINE NEWLINE escape when detected houdin afterwards fell in with ENDLINE NEWLINE him at spa where he found the gambler in the greatest ENDLINE NEWLINE poverty and lent him a small sum to practise his ENDLINE NEWLINE grand theories this sum the gambler lost and ENDLINE NEWLINE houdin advised him to take up a less dangerous occupation ENDLINE NEWLINE it was on this occasion it would seem that ENDLINE NEWLINE the gambler revealed to houdin the particulars recorded ENDLINE NEWLINE in his book a year afterwards houdin unexpectedly ENDLINE NEWLINE fell in with him again but this time the ENDLINE NEWLINE fellow was transformed into what is called a ENDLINE NEWLINE having succeeded to a large fortune on ENDLINE NEWLINE the death of his brother who died intestate according ENDLINE NEWLINE to houdin the following was the mans declaration ENDLINE NEWLINE at the auspicious meeting i have he said completely ENDLINE NEWLINE renounced gaming i am rich enough and ENDLINE NEWLINE care no longer for fortune and yet he added proudly ENDLINE NEWLINE if i now cared for the thing how i could break those ENDLINE NEWLINE bloated banks in their pride and what a glorious ENDLINE NEWLINE vengeance i could take of bad luck and its inflexible ENDLINE NEWLINE agents but my heart is too full of my happiness to ENDLINE NEWLINE allow the smallest place for the desire of vengeance ENDLINE NEWLINE three years later he died and houdin informs us that ENDLINE NEWLINE he left the whole of his fortune to various charitable ENDLINE NEWLINE institutions his career after his acquisition of wealth ENDLINE NEWLINE going far to demonstrate the justice of becky sharps ENDLINE NEWLINE theory that it is easy to be honest on five thousand a ENDLINE NEWLINE year ENDLINE NEWLINE it is remarkable that the principles enunciated above ENDLINE NEWLINE are not merely erroneous but self contradictory yet ENDLINE NEWLINE it is to be noticed that though they are presented as ENDLINE NEWLINE the outcome of a life of gambling experiences they ENDLINE NEWLINE are in reality entertained by all gamblers however ENDLINE NEWLINE limited their experience as well as by many who are ENDLINE NEWLINE only prevented by the lack of opportunity from entering ENDLINE NEWLINE the dangerous path which has led so many to ENDLINE NEWLINE ruin these contradictory superstitions may be called ENDLINE NEWLINE severally the gamblers belief in his own good luck ENDLINE NEWLINE and his faith in the turn of luck when he is considering ENDLINE NEWLINE his own fortune he does not hesitate to believe ENDLINE NEWLINE that on the whole the fates will favour him though ENDLINE NEWLINE this belief implies in reality the of favourable ENDLINE NEWLINE conditions on the contrary when he is considering ENDLINE NEWLINE the fortunes of others who are successful in their play ENDLINE NEWLINE against him he does not doubt that their good luck ENDLINE NEWLINE will presently desert them that is he believes in the ENDLINE NEWLINE of favourable conditions in their case ENDLINE NEWLINE taking in their order the gambling superstitions ENDLINE NEWLINE which have been presented above we have first of all ENDLINE NEWLINE to inquire what truth there is in the idea that there ENDLINE NEWLINE are limits beyond which pure chance has no power of ENDLINE NEWLINE introducing peculiar combinations let us consider ENDLINE NEWLINE this hypothesis in the light of actual experience mr ENDLINE NEWLINE steinmetz tells us that in a mr ogden wagered ENDLINE NEWLINE guineas to one that seven would not be thrown ENDLINE NEWLINE with a pair of dice ten successive times the wager ENDLINE NEWLINE was accepted and ENDLINE NEWLINE strange to say his opponent threw seven at this point mr ogden offered guineas ENDLINE NEWLINE to be off the bet but his opponent declinedhe cast yet once more and threw nine so ENDLINE NEWLINE that mr ogden won his guinea ENDLINE NEWLINE now here we have an instance of a most remarkable ENDLINE NEWLINE series of throws the like of which has never been ENDLINE NEWLINE recorded before or since before those throws had ENDLINE NEWLINE been made it might have been asserted that the ENDLINE NEWLINE throwing of nine successive sevens with a pair of ENDLINE NEWLINE dice was a circumstance which chance could never ENDLINE NEWLINE bring about for experience was as much against such ENDLINE NEWLINE an event as it would seem to be against the turning up ENDLINE NEWLINE of a certain number ten successive times at ENDLINE NEWLINE yet experience now shows that the thing is possible ENDLINE NEWLINE and if we are to limit the action of chance we must ENDLINE NEWLINE assert that the throwing of seven times in succession ENDLINE NEWLINE is an event which will never happen yet such ENDLINE NEWLINE a conclusion obviously rests on as unstable a basis as ENDLINE NEWLINE the former of which experience has disposed observe ENDLINE NEWLINE however how the two gamblers viewed this very eventuality ENDLINE NEWLINE nine successive sevens had been thrown ENDLINE NEWLINE and if there were any truth in the theory that the ENDLINE NEWLINE power of chance was limited it might have been regarded ENDLINE NEWLINE as all but certain that the next throw would ENDLINE NEWLINE not be a seven but a run of bad fortune had so ENDLINE NEWLINE shaken mr ogdens faith in his luck that he was ENDLINE NEWLINE ready to pay guineas in order to ENDLINE NEWLINE save his endangered thousand and so confident was ENDLINE NEWLINE his opponent that the run of luck would continue that ENDLINE NEWLINE he declined this very favourable offer experience had ENDLINE NEWLINE in fact shown both the players that although sevens ENDLINE NEWLINE could not be thrown for ever yet there was no saying ENDLINE NEWLINE when the throw would change both reasoned probably ENDLINE NEWLINE that as an eighth throw had followed seven successive ENDLINE NEWLINE throws of seven and as a ninth ENDLINE NEWLINE had followed eight successive throws a tenth might well follow the ninethey were forced as it were by the run of events ENDLINE NEWLINE to reason justly as to the possibility of a tenth throw ENDLINE NEWLINE of seven nay to exaggerate that possibility into ENDLINE NEWLINE probability and it appears from the narrative that the ENDLINE NEWLINE strange series of throws quite checked the betting propensities ENDLINE NEWLINE of the bystanders and that not one was led to ENDLINE NEWLINE lay the wager that the tenth ENDLINE NEWLINE throw would not give seven ENDLINE NEWLINE we have spoken of the unfairness of the original ENDLINE NEWLINE wager it may interest our readers to know exactly ENDLINE NEWLINE how much should have been wagered against a single ENDLINE NEWLINE guinea that ten sevens would not be thrown with ENDLINE NEWLINE a pair of dice there are thirty six possible throws and ENDLINE NEWLINE six of these give seven as the total thus the chance ENDLINE NEWLINE of throwing seven is one sixth and the chance of ENDLINE NEWLINE throwing seven ten times running is obtained by ENDLINE NEWLINE multiplying six into itself ten times and placing the ENDLINE NEWLINE resulting number under unity to represent the minute ENDLINE NEWLINE fractional chance required it will be found that the ENDLINE NEWLINE number thus obtained is and instead ENDLINE NEWLINE of guineas fairness required that ENDLINE NEWLINE guineas should have been wagered against one guinea ENDLINE NEWLINE so enormous are the chances against the occurrence of ENDLINE NEWLINE ten successive throws of seven even against nine ENDLINE NEWLINE successive throws the fair odds would have been ENDLINE NEWLINE to one or about forty thousand guineas to ENDLINE NEWLINE a farthing but when the nine throws of seven had ENDLINE NEWLINE been made the chance of a tenth throw of seven was ENDLINE NEWLINE simply one sixth as at the first trial if there were ENDLINE NEWLINE any truth in the theory of the maturity of the chances ENDLINE NEWLINE the chance of such a throw would of course be greatly ENDLINE NEWLINE diminished but even taking the mathematical value ENDLINE NEWLINE of the chance mr ogden need in fairness only have ENDLINE NEWLINE offered a sixth part of guineas or guineas to be off his wager ENDLINE NEWLINE so that his opponent accepted in the first instance an ENDLINE NEWLINE utterly unfair offer and refused in the second instance a ENDLINE NEWLINE sum exceeding by more than three hundred guineas the ENDLINE NEWLINE real value of his chance ENDLINE NEWLINE closely connected with the theory about the range ENDLINE NEWLINE of possibility in the matter of chance combinations is ENDLINE NEWLINE the theory of the maturity of the chances the most ENDLINE NEWLINE elementary of the theories on probabilities it might ENDLINE NEWLINE safely be termed the most mischievous of gambling ENDLINE NEWLINE superstitions ENDLINE NEWLINE as an illustration of the application of this theory ENDLINE NEWLINE we may cite the case of an englishman once well ENDLINE NEWLINE known at foreign gambling tables who had based a ENDLINE NEWLINE system on a generalisation of this theory in point of ENDLINE NEWLINE fact the theory asserts that when there has been a run ENDLINE NEWLINE in favour of any particular event the chances in favour ENDLINE NEWLINE of the event are reduced and therefore necessarily ENDLINE NEWLINE the chances in favour of other events are increased ENDLINE NEWLINE now our englishman watched the play at the ENDLINE NEWLINE table for two full hours carefully noting the numbers ENDLINE NEWLINE which came up during that time then eschewing ENDLINE NEWLINE those numbers which had come up oftenest he staked ENDLINE NEWLINE his money on those which had come up very seldom or ENDLINE NEWLINE not at all here was an infallible system according ENDLINE NEWLINE to the most elementary of the theories of probability ENDLINE NEWLINE the tendency of chance results to right themselves so ENDLINE NEWLINE that events equally likely in the first instance will ENDLINE NEWLINE occur an equal number of times in the long run was ENDLINE NEWLINE called into action to enrich our gambler and to ruin ENDLINE NEWLINE the unlucky bankers be it noted in passing that ENDLINE NEWLINE events do thus right themselves though this circumstance ENDLINE NEWLINE does not operate quite as the gambler supposed ENDLINE NEWLINE and cannot be trusted to put a penny into any ones ENDLINE NEWLINE pocket the system was tried however and instead ENDLINE NEWLINE of reasoning respecting its soundness we may content ENDLINE NEWLINE ourselves with recording the result on the first day ENDLINE NEWLINE our englishman won more than seven hundred pounds ENDLINE NEWLINE in a single hour his exultation was boundless he ENDLINE NEWLINE thought he had really discovered the philosophers ENDLINE NEWLINE stone off he went to his bankers and transmitted ENDLINE NEWLINE the greater portion of his winnings to london the ENDLINE NEWLINE next day he played and lost fifty pounds and the ENDLINE NEWLINE following day he achieved the same result and had to ENDLINE NEWLINE write to town for remittances in fine in a week he ENDLINE NEWLINE had lost all the money he won at first with the ENDLINE NEWLINE exception of fifty pounds which he reserved to take ENDLINE NEWLINE him home and being thoroughly convinced of the ENDLINE NEWLINE exceeding fickleness of fortune he has never staked a ENDLINE NEWLINE sixpence since and does all in his power to dissuade ENDLINE NEWLINE others from playing ENDLINE NEWLINE he took a very sound principle of probabilities as ENDLINE NEWLINE the supposed basis of his system though in reality he ENDLINE NEWLINE entirely mistook the nature of the principle that ENDLINE NEWLINE principle is that where the chances for one or another ENDLINE NEWLINE of two results are equal for each trial and many trials ENDLINE NEWLINE are made the number of events of one kind will bear to ENDLINE NEWLINE those of the other kind a very nearly equal ratio the ENDLINE NEWLINE greater the number of events the more nearly will the ENDLINE NEWLINE ratio tend to equality this is perfectly true and ENDLINE NEWLINE nothing could be safer than to wager on this principle ENDLINE NEWLINE let a man toss a coin for an hour and i would wager ENDLINE NEWLINE confidently that neither will heads exceed tails or ENDLINE NEWLINE tails exceed heads in a greater ratio than that of ENDLINE NEWLINE to let him toss for a day and i would wager ENDLINE NEWLINE as confidently that the inequality will not be greater ENDLINE NEWLINE than that represented by the ratio of to let ENDLINE NEWLINE the tossing be repeated day after day for a year and i ENDLINE NEWLINE would wager my life that the disproportion will be less ENDLINE NEWLINE than that represented by the ratio of to ENDLINE NEWLINE yet so little does this principle bear the interpretation ENDLINE NEWLINE placed upon it by the inventor of the system above ENDLINE NEWLINE described that if on any occasion during this long continued ENDLINE NEWLINE process of tossings head had been tossed no less than twenty times in ENDLINE NEWLINE succession i would not wager a sixpence on the next ENDLINE NEWLINE tossing giving tail or trust a sixpence to the chance of ENDLINE NEWLINE tail appearing oftener than head in the next five ten ENDLINE NEWLINE or twenty tossings not only should reason show the ENDLINE NEWLINE utter absurdity of supposing that a tossing or a set of ENDLINE NEWLINE five ten or twenty tossings can be affected one way or ENDLINE NEWLINE the other by past tossings whether proximate or remote ENDLINE NEWLINE but the experiment has been tried and it has appeared ENDLINE NEWLINE that after any ENDLINE NEWLINE number of cases in which heads have appeared ENDLINE NEWLINE such and such a number of times in succession the next ENDLINE NEWLINE tossing has given heads as often as it has given tails ENDLINE NEWLINE thus in cases buffon in his famous tossing trial ENDLINE NEWLINE tossed tails four times running on the next trial ENDLINE NEWLINE in these cases head came times and tail ENDLINE NEWLINE times so most certainly the tossing of tail four ENDLINE NEWLINE times running had not diminished the tendency towards ENDLINE NEWLINE tail being tossed among the cases which had ENDLINE NEWLINE thus given tail five times running failed to give ENDLINE NEWLINE another tail while the remaining gave another ENDLINE NEWLINE that is a sixth tail of these failed to give ENDLINE NEWLINE another tail while gave a seventh tail and here ENDLINE NEWLINE it might seem we have evidence of the effect of preceding ENDLINE NEWLINE tosses the disproportion is considerable and ENDLINE NEWLINE even to the mathematician the case is certainly curious ENDLINE NEWLINE but in so many trials such curiosities may always be ENDLINE NEWLINE noticed that it will not bear the interpretation put ENDLINE NEWLINE upon it is shown by the next steps of the cases ENDLINE NEWLINE failed to give another tail while the remaining six ENDLINE NEWLINE gave another that is an eighth tail and these ENDLINE NEWLINE numbers eight and six are more nearly equal than the ENDLINE NEWLINE preceding numbers andso that the tendency to ENDLINE NEWLINE change had certainly not increased at this step however ENDLINE NEWLINE the numbers are too small in this part of the experiment ENDLINE NEWLINE to give results which can be relied upon ENDLINE NEWLINE the cases in which the numbers were large prove unmistakably ENDLINE NEWLINE what reason ought to have made self evident ENDLINE NEWLINE that past events of pure chance cannot in the ENDLINE NEWLINE slightest degree affect the result of sequent trials ENDLINE NEWLINE to suppose otherwise is indeed utterly to ignore ENDLINE NEWLINE the relation between cause and effect when anyone ENDLINE NEWLINE asserts that because such and such things have happened ENDLINE NEWLINE therefore such and such other events will happen he ENDLINE NEWLINE ought at least to be able to show that the past events ENDLINE NEWLINE have some direct influence on those which are thus said ENDLINE NEWLINE to be affected by them but if i am going to toss a ENDLINE NEWLINE coin perfectly at random in what possible way can the ENDLINE NEWLINE result of the experiment be affected by the circumstance ENDLINE NEWLINE that during ten or twelve minutes before i tossed head ENDLINE NEWLINE only or tail only ENDLINE NEWLINE the system of which i now propose to speak is more ENDLINE NEWLINE plausible less readily put to the full test and consequently ENDLINE NEWLINE far more dangerous than the one just described ENDLINE NEWLINE in it as in the other reliance is placed on a change ENDLINE NEWLINE after a run of any kind but not in the same way ENDLINE NEWLINE everyone is familiar with the method of renewing ENDLINE NEWLINE wagers on the terms double or quits it is a very ENDLINE NEWLINE convenient way of getting rid of money which has been ENDLINE NEWLINE won on a wager by one who does not care for wagering ENDLINE NEWLINE and not being to the manner born does not feel comfortable ENDLINE NEWLINE in pocketing money won in this way you ENDLINE NEWLINE have rashly backed some favourite oarsman let us say ENDLINE NEWLINE or your college boat or the like for a level sovereign ENDLINE NEWLINE not caring to win but accepting a challenge to so wager ENDLINE NEWLINE rather than seem to want faith in your friend college ENDLINE NEWLINE or university you thus find yourself suddenly the ENDLINE NEWLINE recipient of a coin to which you feel you are about as ENDLINE NEWLINE much entitled as though you had abstracted it from the ENDLINE NEWLINE other bettors pocket you offer him double or quits ENDLINE NEWLINE tossing the coin perhaps he loses when you would be ENDLINE NEWLINE entitled to two sovereigns you repeat the offer and if ENDLINE NEWLINE he again loses ENDLINE NEWLINE you again repeat it until at last he wins the toss then ENDLINE NEWLINE you are quits and can be happy again ENDLINE NEWLINE the system of winning money corresponds to this ENDLINE NEWLINE safe system of getting rid of money which has been ENDLINE NEWLINE uncomfortably won observe that if you only go on ENDLINE NEWLINE long enough with the double or quits method as above ENDLINE NEWLINE you are sure to get rid of your sovereign for your ENDLINE NEWLINE friend cannot go on losing for ever he might indeed ENDLINE NEWLINE lose nine or ten times running when he would owe you ENDLINE NEWLINE or and if he then lost heart while yet he ENDLINE NEWLINE regarded his loss like his first wager as a debt of honour ENDLINE NEWLINE from which you could not release him matters would ENDLINE NEWLINE be rather awkward if he lost twenty times he would ENDLINE NEWLINE owe you a million which would be more awkward still ENDLINE NEWLINE except that having gone so far he could not make ENDLINE NEWLINE matters worse by going a little farther and in a few ENDLINE NEWLINE more tossings you would get rid of your millions as ENDLINE NEWLINE completely as of the sovereign first won still speaking ENDLINE NEWLINE generally this double or quits method is a sure and ENDLINE NEWLINE easy way of clearing such scores but it may be reversed ENDLINE NEWLINE and become a pretty sure and easy way of making ENDLINE NEWLINE money ENDLINE NEWLINE suppose a man whom we will call a to wager with ENDLINE NEWLINE another b one sovereign on a tossingif he ENDLINE NEWLINE wins he gains a sovereign suppose however he loses ENDLINE NEWLINE his sovereign then let him make a new wager of two ENDLINE NEWLINE sovereigns if he wins he is the gainer of one sovereign ENDLINE NEWLINE in all if he loses he has lost three in all in the latter ENDLINE NEWLINE case let him make a new wager of four sovereigns if ENDLINE NEWLINE he wins he gains one sovereign if he loses he has ENDLINE NEWLINE lost seven in all in this last case let him wager ENDLINE NEWLINE eight sovereigns then if he wins he has gained one ENDLINE NEWLINE sovereign and if he loses he has lost fifteen wagering ENDLINE NEWLINE sixteen sovereigns in the latter case he gains one in all ENDLINE NEWLINE if he wins and has lost thirty one in all if he loses so ENDLINE NEWLINE he goes on doubling ENDLINE NEWLINE his wager continually until at last he wins then he ENDLINE NEWLINE has gained one sovereign he can now repeat the ENDLINE NEWLINE process gaining each time a sovereign whenever he ENDLINE NEWLINE wins a tossing and manifestly in this way a can ENDLINE NEWLINE most surely and safely win every sovereign b has yet ENDLINE NEWLINE every wager has been a perfectly fair one we seem ENDLINE NEWLINE then to see our way to a safe way of making any ENDLINE NEWLINE quantity of money b of course would not allow this ENDLINE NEWLINE sort of wagering to go on very long but the bankers ENDLINE NEWLINE of a gambling establishment undertake to accept any ENDLINE NEWLINE wagers which may be offered on the system of their ENDLINE NEWLINE game whether roulette or what not ENDLINE NEWLINE between certain limits of value in the stakes say these ENDLINE NEWLINE limits are from to as i am told is not uncommonly ENDLINE NEWLINE the case a man may wager on this plan ENDLINE NEWLINE and double eight times before his doublings carry the ENDLINE NEWLINE stake above or with more advantage he may let ENDLINE NEWLINE the successive stakes be such that the eighth doubling ENDLINE NEWLINE will make the maximum sum or so that the ENDLINE NEWLINE stakes in inverse order will be ENDLINE NEWLINE and lastly ENDLINE NEWLINE nine stakes or eight doublings in all it is so ENDLINE NEWLINE utterly unlikely says the believer in this system that ENDLINE NEWLINE where the chances are practically equal on two events ENDLINE NEWLINE the same event will be repeated nine times running ENDLINE NEWLINE that i may safely apply this method gaining at each ENDLINE NEWLINE venture ENDLINE NEWLINE until at last i shall accumulate in this way a small ENDLINE NEWLINE fortune which in time will become a large fortune ENDLINE NEWLINE the proprietors of gambling houses naturally encourage ENDLINE NEWLINE this pleasing delusion they call this power of ENDLINE NEWLINE varying the stakes a very important advantage possessed ENDLINE NEWLINE by the player at such tables they say truly enough ENDLINE NEWLINE a single player would not wager if the stakes could be ENDLINE NEWLINE varied in this manner and he possessed no power of refusing ENDLINE NEWLINE any offer between such limits since a single ENDLINE NEWLINE player would refuse to allow this arrangement it is ENDLINE NEWLINE manifest the arrangement is a privilege being a ENDLINE NEWLINE privilege it is worth paying for it is on this account ENDLINE NEWLINE that we poor bankers who oblige those possessed of ENDLINE NEWLINE gambling propensities by allowing them to exercise ENDLINE NEWLINE their tastes that way must have a certain small percentage ENDLINE NEWLINE of odds in our favour thus at ENDLINE NEWLINE we really must have one of the refaits allowed us say ENDLINE NEWLINE the first the though any other would suit ENDLINE NEWLINE us equally well but even then we do not win what is ENDLINE NEWLINE on the table the may go against us when the ENDLINE NEWLINE players save their stakes and if we win we only win ENDLINE NEWLINE what has been staked on one colour and so forth ENDLINE NEWLINE those who like gambling too and so like to believe ENDLINE NEWLINE that the bankers are strictly fair adopt this argument ENDLINE NEWLINE thus the editor of says the ENDLINE NEWLINE table at all games has an extra chance a chance varying ENDLINE NEWLINE from one zero at one table to two at another that is a ENDLINE NEWLINE chance every player understands when he sits down to ENDLINE NEWLINE play that this ENDLINE NEWLINE advantage over a long series must tell is as certain as ENDLINE NEWLINE that two and two make four but the bank ENDLINE NEWLINE does not always win on the contrary we often hear ENDLINE NEWLINE of the bank being broken and closed until more cash is ENDLINE NEWLINE forthcoming the number of times the bank loses ENDLINE NEWLINE and nothing is said about it would amount to a considerable ENDLINE NEWLINE number of times in the course of a year a ENDLINE NEWLINE small percentage on one side or the other extended over ENDLINE NEWLINE a long enough series will tell but on a single event ENDLINE NEWLINE the difference in the gamblers eyes is small for that percentage the punter is ENDLINE NEWLINE enabled to vary his stakes from say to without ENDLINE NEWLINE some such advantage no one would permit his ENDLINE NEWLINE adversaries thus to vary the stakes the punter is willing to pay for this advantage ENDLINE NEWLINE and all the while the truth is that the supposed ENDLINE NEWLINE advantage is no advantage at all at least to the player ENDLINE NEWLINE it is of immense advantage to the bankers because it ENDLINE NEWLINE encourages so many to play who otherwise might refrain ENDLINE NEWLINE but in reality the bankers would make the same winnings ENDLINE NEWLINE if every stake were of a fixed amount say ENDLINE NEWLINE as when the stakes can be varied always assuming ENDLINE NEWLINE that as many players would come to them and play as ENDLINE NEWLINE freely as on the present more attractive system ENDLINE NEWLINE let us consider the actual state of the case when a ENDLINE NEWLINE player at a table doubles his stakes till he wins repeating ENDLINE NEWLINE the process from the lowest stakes after each ENDLINE NEWLINE success ENDLINE NEWLINE but first or rather as a part of this inquiry let ENDLINE NEWLINE us consider why our imaginary player b would decline ENDLINE NEWLINE to allow a to double wagers in the manner described ENDLINE NEWLINE in reality of course as power of doubling is limited ENDLINE NEWLINE by the amount of as money or of his available money ENDLINE NEWLINE for gambling he cannot go on doubling the stakes ENDLINE NEWLINE when he has paid away more than half his money ENDLINE NEWLINE suppose for instance he has in notes and ENDLINE NEWLINE or so in sovereigns but if he loses his last ENDLINE NEWLINE wager he will have paid away and must stop for ENDLINE NEWLINE the time leaving b the gainer of that sum this is a ENDLINE NEWLINE very unlikely result for a single trial it would not be ENDLINE NEWLINE likely to happen in a hundred or in two hundred trials ENDLINE NEWLINE though it might happen at the first trial or at a very ENDLINE NEWLINE early one even if it happened after five hundred ENDLINE NEWLINE trials a would only have won in those and b ENDLINE NEWLINE winning at the last would have much the better ENDLINE NEWLINE of the encounter ENDLINE NEWLINE why then would not b be willing to wager on ENDLINE NEWLINE these terms for precisely the same reason that he should be ENDLINE NEWLINE unwilling to pay for one ticket out of where ENDLINE NEWLINE the prize was each ticket would be fairly worth ENDLINE NEWLINE that sum and many foolish persons as we know are ENDLINE NEWLINE willing to pay in that way for a ticket in a lottery even ENDLINE NEWLINE paying more than the correct value but no one of any ENDLINE NEWLINE sense would throw away a sovereign for the chance of winning a thousand ENDLINE NEWLINE pounds that really is what b declines to do every ENDLINE NEWLINE venture he makes with a is a wager on just such terms b wins ENDLINE NEWLINE nothing unless he wins he loses at each ENDLINE NEWLINE failure his chance of winning too is the same at ENDLINE NEWLINE each venture as that of drawing a single marked ticket ENDLINE NEWLINE from a bag containing tickets each venture ENDLINE NEWLINE though it may be decided at the first or second tossing ENDLINE NEWLINE is a venture of ten tossings now with ten tossings ENDLINE NEWLINE there are possible results any one of which is as ENDLINE NEWLINE likely as any other one of these and one only is ENDLINE NEWLINE favourable to b viz though in reality he does ENDLINE NEWLINE not pay the pound until the venture is decided against ENDLINE NEWLINE him so that if he wins he receives corresponding ENDLINE NEWLINE to the total just named ENDLINE NEWLINE now to wager a pound in this way for the chance ENDLINE NEWLINE of winning would be very foolish and though ENDLINE NEWLINE continually repeating the experiment would in the long ENDLINE NEWLINE run make the number of successes bear the right proportion ENDLINE NEWLINE to the number of failures yet b might be ENDLINE NEWLINE ruined long before this happened though quite as probably ENDLINE NEWLINE a would be ruined bs ruin if effected would ENDLINE NEWLINE be brought about by steadily continued small losses as ENDLINE NEWLINE by a casual but overwhelming loss the richer b and ENDLINE NEWLINE a were the longer it would be before one or other was ENDLINE NEWLINE ruined though the eventual ruin of one or other would ENDLINE NEWLINE be certain if one was much richer than the other his ENDLINE NEWLINE chance of escaping ruin would be so much the greater ENDLINE NEWLINE and so much greater therefore the risk of the poorer ENDLINE NEWLINE in other words the odds would be great in favour of the ENDLINE NEWLINE richer of the two whether a or b absorbing the whole ENDLINE NEWLINE property of the other if wagering on this plan were ENDLINE NEWLINE continued steadily for a long time ENDLINE NEWLINE now if we extend such considerations as these to ENDLINE NEWLINE the case in which an individual player contends against ENDLINE NEWLINE a bank we shall see that even without any percentage ENDLINE NEWLINE on the chances the odds would be largely in favour of ENDLINE NEWLINE the bank if the player is persistent in applying his ENDLINE NEWLINE system he is practically certain to be ruined for it is ENDLINE NEWLINE to be noticed that in such a system the player is exposed ENDLINE NEWLINE to that which he can least afford namely sudden and ENDLINE NEWLINE great loss it is by such losses that his ruin will be ENDLINE NEWLINE brought about if at all on the other hand the bank ENDLINE NEWLINE which can best afford such losses has to meet only ENDLINE NEWLINE a steady slow drain upon its resources until the inevitable ENDLINE NEWLINE comes which restore all that had been thus ENDLINE NEWLINE drained out and more along with it if the player ENDLINE NEWLINE were even to carry on his system in the manner which ENDLINE NEWLINE my reasoning has really implied if as he made his ENDLINE NEWLINE small gain at each venture he set it by to form a reserve ENDLINE NEWLINE fund even then his ruin would be inevitable in the ENDLINE NEWLINE long run but every one knows that gamblers do ENDLINE NEWLINE nothing of the sort lightly come lightly go is their ENDLINE NEWLINE rule so far as their gains are concerned in another ENDLINE NEWLINE sense their rule is lightly come ENDLINE NEWLINE and heavily go when the last pound has been staked and ENDLINE NEWLINE lost thus they run a risk which in their way of ENDLINE NEWLINE playing amounts almost to a certainty of ruining themselves ENDLINE NEWLINE and they do not even take the precaution which ENDLINE NEWLINE would alone give them their one small almost evanescent ENDLINE NEWLINE chance of escape on the other hand the bankers ENDLINE NEWLINE who are really playing an almost perfectly safe game ENDLINE NEWLINE leave nothing to chance the bulk of the money gained ENDLINE NEWLINE by them is reserved to maintain the balance necessary ENDLINE NEWLINE for safety only the actual profits of their system the ENDLINE NEWLINE percentage of gain due to their percentage on the chances is ENDLINE NEWLINE dealt with as income that is as money to be spent ENDLINE NEWLINE it is true that in one sense the case between the ENDLINE NEWLINE bankers and the public resembles that of a player with ENDLINE NEWLINE a small capital against a player with a large capital ENDLINE NEWLINE the bankers have indeed a large capital but it is small ENDLINE NEWLINE compared with that of the public at large who frequent ENDLINE NEWLINE the gaming tables but in the first place this ENDLINE NEWLINE does not at all help any single player it is all but ENDLINE NEWLINE certain that the public will not be ruined as a whole just as it ENDLINE NEWLINE is all but certain that the whole of an army engaged in ENDLINE NEWLINE a campaign even under the most unfavourable circumstances ENDLINE NEWLINE will not be destroyed if recruits are always ENDLINE NEWLINE available at short notice now if the circumstances of ENDLINE NEWLINE a campaign are such that each individual soldier runs ENDLINE NEWLINE exceeding risk of being killed it will not improve the ENDLINE NEWLINE chances of any single soldier that the army as a whole ENDLINE NEWLINE will not be destroyed and in like manner those who ENDLINE NEWLINE gamble persistently are not helped in their ruin by the ENDLINE NEWLINE circumstance that as one is pushed from the board ENDLINE NEWLINE others ever succeed even the chance of the bank ENDLINE NEWLINE being ruined however is not favourable to the gambler ENDLINE NEWLINE who follows such a system as i am dealing with but ENDLINE NEWLINE positively adds to his risks in the illustrative case of ENDLINE NEWLINE a playing b the ruin of b meant that a had gained ENDLINE NEWLINE all bs money but in the case of a gambler playing on ENDLINE NEWLINE the doubling system at a gaming table the ruin of the ENDLINE NEWLINE bank would be one of the chances against him that such ENDLINE NEWLINE a gambler would have to take into account it might ENDLINE NEWLINE happen when he was far on in a long process of doubling ENDLINE NEWLINE and would be almost certain to happen when he had to ENDLINE NEWLINE some degree entered on such a process he would then ENDLINE NEWLINE be certainly a loser on that particular venture if a ENDLINE NEWLINE winner on the event actually decided when the bank ENDLINE NEWLINE broke he would perhaps receive a share but ENDLINE NEWLINE a share only of the available assets the rules of the ENDLINE NEWLINE table may be such that these will always cover the stakes ENDLINE NEWLINE and in that case the player supposing he had won on ENDLINE NEWLINE the last event decided would sustain no loss should ENDLINE NEWLINE he have lost on that event however which ordinarily ENDLINE NEWLINE would at least not interfere with the operation of his ENDLINE NEWLINE system he is prevented from pursuing the system till he ENDLINE NEWLINE has recouped his loss this can never happen in play ENDLINE NEWLINE between two gamblers on this system for the very ENDLINE NEWLINE circumstance that a has lost an event involves of necessity ENDLINE NEWLINE the possession by b of enough money to continue ENDLINE NEWLINE the system bs stake after winning is always double ENDLINE NEWLINE the last stake but after winning the amount just staked ENDLINE NEWLINE of course he must possess double that amount since he ENDLINE NEWLINE has his winnings and also a sum at least equal which ENDLINE NEWLINE he must have had when he wagered an equal stake ENDLINE NEWLINE but when a player at the gaming tables loses an event ENDLINE NEWLINE in one of his ventures it by no means follows equally ENDLINE NEWLINE that the bank can continue to doublelosses ENDLINE NEWLINE against other players may compel the bank to close when ENDLINE NEWLINE the system player has just lost a tolerably heavy ENDLINE NEWLINE his system then is defeated and he sustains a loss ENDLINE NEWLINE distinct in character from those which his system normally ENDLINE NEWLINE involves in other words the chances against ENDLINE NEWLINE him are increased and on the other hand the bankers ENDLINE NEWLINE chance of ruin would be small even if they had no ENDLINE NEWLINE advantage in the odds simply because the sum staked ENDLINE NEWLINE bears a much smaller proportion to their capital than the ENDLINE NEWLINE wagers of the individual player bear to his property ENDLINE NEWLINE yet the reader must not fall into the mistake of ENDLINE NEWLINE supposing that because the individual player would have ENDLINE NEWLINE enormous risks against him even if the bankers took no ENDLINE NEWLINE percentage on the chances the bank would then in the ENDLINE NEWLINE long run make enormous gains that would be a paradoxical ENDLINE NEWLINE result though at first sight it seems equally ENDLINE NEWLINE paradoxical to say that while every single player would ENDLINE NEWLINE be almost certain to be ruined the bank would not ENDLINE NEWLINE gain in the long run this however is perfectly true ENDLINE NEWLINE the fact is that among the few who escaped ruin some ENDLINE NEWLINE would be enormous gainers it would be because of ENDLINE NEWLINE some marvellous runs of luck and consequent enormous ENDLINE NEWLINE gains that they would be saved from ruin and the ENDLINE NEWLINE chances would be that some among these would be very ENDLINE NEWLINE heavy gainers they would be few and the action of a ENDLINE NEWLINE man who gambled heavily on the chance of being one of ENDLINE NEWLINE these few would be like that of a man who bought ENDLINE NEWLINE half a dozen tickets at a price of each among millions of ENDLINE NEWLINE tickets in a lottery in which were a few prizes of ENDLINE NEWLINE each but though the smallness of the ENDLINE NEWLINE chance of being one among the few very great gainers at ENDLINE NEWLINE the gambling table makes it absurd for a man to run the ENDLINE NEWLINE enormous risk of ruin involved in persistent play yet ENDLINE NEWLINE so far as the bankers would be concerned the great ENDLINE NEWLINE losses on the few winners would in the long run equalise ENDLINE NEWLINE the moderate gains on the great majority of their ENDLINE NEWLINE customers they would neither gain nor lose a sum ENDLINE NEWLINE bearing any considerable proportion to their ventures ENDLINE NEWLINE and would run some risk though only a small one ENDLINE NEWLINE of being swamped by a long continued run of bad ENDLINE NEWLINE luck ENDLINE NEWLINE but the bankers do not in this way leave matters to ENDLINE NEWLINE chance they take a percentage on the chances the ENDLINE NEWLINE percentage they take is often not very large in itself ENDLINE NEWLINE though it is nearly always larger than it appears even ENDLINE NEWLINE when regarded properly as a percentage on the chances ENDLINE NEWLINE but what is usually overlooked by those who deal with ENDLINE NEWLINE this matter and especially by those who being gamblers ENDLINE NEWLINE themselves to think that gaming houses give them ENDLINE NEWLINE very fair chances is that a very small percentage on the ENDLINE NEWLINE chances may mean and necessarily does mean an ENDLINE NEWLINE enormous percentage of profits ENDLINE NEWLINE let us take as illustrating both the seeming smallness ENDLINE NEWLINE of the percentage on the chances and the enormous ENDLINE NEWLINE probable percentage of profits the game of ENDLINE NEWLINE so far as it can be understood from the accounts ENDLINE NEWLINE given in the books ENDLINE NEWLINE i follow de morgans rendering ENDLINE NEWLINE of these confused and imperfect accounts it seems to ENDLINE NEWLINE be correct for his computation of the odds for and ENDLINE NEWLINE against the player leads to the same result as poisson ENDLINE NEWLINE obtained who knew the game though he nowhere gives ENDLINE NEWLINE a description of it ENDLINE NEWLINE a number of packs is taken and ENDLINE NEWLINE the cards are well mixed bach common card counts ENDLINE NEWLINE for the number of spots on it and the court cards are ENDLINE NEWLINE each reckoned as ten a table is divided into two compartments ENDLINE NEWLINE one called the other and a player ENDLINE NEWLINE stakes his money in which he pleases the proprietor ENDLINE NEWLINE of the bank who risks against all comers then lays ENDLINE NEWLINE down cards in one compartment until the number of ENDLINE NEWLINE spots exceeds thirty as soon as this has happened he ENDLINE NEWLINE proceeds in the same way with the other compartment ENDLINE NEWLINE the number of spots in each compartment is thus ENDLINE NEWLINE necessarily between and both inclusive the compartment ENDLINE NEWLINE in which the total number of spots is least is ENDLINE NEWLINE the winning one thus if there are spots on the ENDLINE NEWLINE cards in the and on the cards in the ENDLINE NEWLINE wins and all players who staked upon receive ENDLINE NEWLINE from the bank sums equal to their stakes the process ENDLINE NEWLINE is then repeated so far it will be observed the chances ENDLINE NEWLINE are equal for the players and for the bankers it will ENDLINE NEWLINE also be observed that the arrangement is one which ENDLINE NEWLINE strongly favours the idea that the bankers have ENDLINE NEWLINE little interest in the result for the bank does not back ENDLINE NEWLINE either colour the players have all the backing to ENDLINE NEWLINE themselves if they choose to stake more in all on the ENDLINE NEWLINE red than on the black it becomes the banks interest ENDLINE NEWLINE that black should win but it was by the players own ENDLINE NEWLINE acts that black became for the time the banks colour ENDLINE NEWLINE and not only does this suggest to the players the incorrect ENDLINE NEWLINE idea that the bank has little real interest in ENDLINE NEWLINE the game but it encourages the correct idea which it is ENDLINE NEWLINE the manifest interest of the bankers to put very clearly ENDLINE NEWLINE before the players that everything is fairly managed ENDLINE NEWLINE if the bank chose a colour some might think that the ENDLINE NEWLINE cards however seemingly shuffled were in reality arranged ENDLINE NEWLINE or else were so manipulated as to make the ENDLINE NEWLINE banks colour win oftener than it should do but since ENDLINE NEWLINE the players themselves settle which shall be the banks ENDLINE NEWLINE colour at each trial there cannot be suspicion of foul ENDLINE NEWLINE play of this sort ENDLINE NEWLINE we now come to the banks advantage on the ENDLINE NEWLINE chances the number of spots in the black and red ENDLINE NEWLINE compartments may be equal in this case the game is drawn and the players may ENDLINE NEWLINE either withdraw increase or diminish their stakes as ENDLINE NEWLINE they please for a new game if the number of spots in ENDLINE NEWLINE each compartment is any except but if the number ENDLINE NEWLINE in each be then the players are not allowed to withdraw their ENDLINE NEWLINE stakes and not only must the stakes remain for a new ENDLINE NEWLINE game but whatever happens on this new trial the ENDLINE NEWLINE players will receive nothing their stakes are for the ENDLINE NEWLINE moment impoundedthe new game unless it ENDLINE NEWLINE chances to give another will end in favour of ENDLINE NEWLINE either or whichever compartment wins the ENDLINE NEWLINE players in that compartment save their stakes but ENDLINE NEWLINE receive nothing from the bank the players who have ENDLINE NEWLINE put their stakes in the other compartment lose them ENDLINE NEWLINE de morgan says here not quite correctly should the ENDLINE NEWLINE bank win it takes the stakes should the bank lose the ENDLINE NEWLINE player recovers his stakes this is incorrect because ENDLINE NEWLINE it at least suggests the incorrect idea that the bank may ENDLINE NEWLINE either win or the stakes go clear whereas in reality ENDLINE NEWLINE except in the improbable event of all the players backing ENDLINE NEWLINE one colour the bank is sure to win something viz ENDLINE NEWLINE either the stakes in the red or those in the black compartment ENDLINE NEWLINE and the only point to be settled is whether ENDLINE NEWLINE the larger or the smaller of these probably unequal ENDLINE NEWLINE sums shall pass to the banks exchequer if the s ENDLINE NEWLINE gives a second the stakes still remain impounded ENDLINE NEWLINE and another game is played and no stakes are released ENDLINE NEWLINE until either or has won but in the meantime ENDLINE NEWLINE new stakes may be put down before the fate of ENDLINE NEWLINE the impounded stakes has been decided ENDLINE NEWLINE thus whereas with regard to games decided at the ENDLINE NEWLINE first trial the bank has in the long run no interest one ENDLINE NEWLINE way or the other the bank has an exceptional interest ENDLINE NEWLINE in a at once gives the ENDLINE NEWLINE bank a certainty of winning the least sum staked in ENDLINE NEWLINE the two compartments and an equal chance of winning ENDLINE NEWLINE the larger sum instead any gives the bank ENDLINE NEWLINE the chance that on a new trial a may ENDLINE NEWLINE be made and though this chance is small it tells in the long run and ENDLINE NEWLINE must be added to the advantage obtained from the ENDLINE NEWLINE chance of a at once ENDLINE NEWLINE now it may seem as though the bank would gain ENDLINE NEWLINE very little from so small an advantage a may ENDLINE NEWLINE occur tolerably often in any long series of trials but a ENDLINE NEWLINE only at long intervals it is only one ENDLINE NEWLINE out of ten different which to the uninitiated ENDLINE NEWLINE seem all equally likely to occur so that he supposes ENDLINE NEWLINE the chance of a to be only one tenth ENDLINE NEWLINE of the chance that there will ENDLINE NEWLINE be a of some sort but to begin with this supposition ENDLINE NEWLINE is incorrect calculation shows that the chance of ENDLINE NEWLINE a of some sort occurring is in or ENDLINE NEWLINE nearly one in nine the chance of a ENDLINE NEWLINE is not one tenth of this or about in but ENDLINE NEWLINE in or twice as great as the uninitiated ENDLINE NEWLINE imagine thus in very nearly two games in ENDLINE NEWLINE instead of one game in a occurs ENDLINE NEWLINE it follows from this combined with the circumstance ENDLINE NEWLINE that on the average the bank wins half its stakes only ENDLINE NEWLINE in the case of one of these ENDLINE NEWLINE that the mathematical advantage of the bank is ENDLINE NEWLINE very nearly one ninetieth of all the sums deposited ENDLINE NEWLINE and in passing it may be noticed as affording good ENDLINE NEWLINE illustration of the mistakes the uninitiated are apt to ENDLINE NEWLINE make in such matters that if instead of the ENDLINE NEWLINE the bankers took to themselves the ENDLINE NEWLINE then instead of this percentage per deposit the percentage ENDLINE NEWLINE would be only or per ENDLINE NEWLINE but even an average advantage of per on ENDLINE NEWLINE each deposit made by the bank is thought by the frequenters ENDLINE NEWLINE of the table to be very slight it makes the odds ENDLINE NEWLINE against the players about to on each trial and the ENDLINE NEWLINE difference seems trifling on considering the probable ENDLINE NEWLINE results of a years play however we find that the ENDLINE NEWLINE bankers could obtain tremendous interest for a capital ENDLINE NEWLINE which would make them far safer against ruin than is ENDLINE NEWLINE thought necessary in any ordinary mercantile business ENDLINE NEWLINE i follow de morgan in taking these numbers which are ENDLINE NEWLINE far below what would generally be deposited in ENDLINE NEWLINE evenings of play now it can be shown that if the ENDLINE NEWLINE bankers started with such a sum as they would ENDLINE NEWLINE be practically safe from all chance of ruin so that in ENDLINE NEWLINE playing nights they would probably make cent as he justly says the ENDLINE NEWLINE preceding results or either of them being admitted ENDLINE NEWLINE it might be supposed hardly necessary to dwell upon ENDLINE NEWLINE the ruin which must necessarily result to individual ENDLINE NEWLINE players against a bank which has so strong a chance of ENDLINE NEWLINE success against its united antagonists but he adds ENDLINE NEWLINE so strangely are opinions formed upon this subject ENDLINE NEWLINE that it is not uncommon to find persons who think they ENDLINE NEWLINE are in possession of a specific by which they must infallibly ENDLINE NEWLINE win if both the banker and the player staked ENDLINE NEWLINE on each gameth part of their respective funds ENDLINE NEWLINE and the play was to continue till one or other side was ENDLINE NEWLINE ruined the bank would have chances to in its ENDLINE NEWLINE favour against that one player but if as more commonly ENDLINE NEWLINE is the case the players stake formed a far larger ENDLINE NEWLINE proportion of his property these odds would be immensely ENDLINE NEWLINE increased if a player staked one tenth of his ENDLINE NEWLINE money on each game against the same sum supposed ENDLINE NEWLINE to beth of the banks money the chances would ENDLINE NEWLINE be to that he would be ruined if he persisted ENDLINE NEWLINE long enough in other words his chance of escaping ENDLINE NEWLINE ruin would be the same as that of drawing one single ENDLINE NEWLINE marked ball out of a bag containing ENDLINE NEWLINE other games played at the gaming tables however ENDLINE NEWLINE different in character they may be from ENDLINE NEWLINE give no better chances to the players indeed some ENDLINE NEWLINE games give far inferior chances there is not one of ENDLINE NEWLINE them at which any system of play can be safe in the ENDLINE NEWLINE long run if the system is such that the risk on each ENDLINE NEWLINE venture is small then the gains on each venture will ENDLINE NEWLINE be correspondingly small many ventures therefore ENDLINE NEWLINE must be made in order to secure any considerable ENDLINE NEWLINE gains and when once the number of ventures is ENDLINE NEWLINE largely increased the small risk on each becomes a ENDLINE NEWLINE large risk and if the ventures be very numerous ENDLINE NEWLINE becomes practically a certainty of loss on the other ENDLINE NEWLINE hand there are modes of venturing which if successful ENDLINE NEWLINE once only bring in a large profit but they involve a ENDLINE NEWLINE larger immediate risk ENDLINE NEWLINE in point of fact the supposition that any system ENDLINE NEWLINE can be devised by which success in games of chance ENDLINE NEWLINE may be made certain is as utterly unphilosophical as ENDLINE NEWLINE faith in the invention of perpetual motion that the ENDLINE NEWLINE supposition has been entertained by many who have ENDLINE NEWLINE passed all their lives in gambling proves only what ENDLINE NEWLINE might also be safely inferred from the very fact of their ENDLINE NEWLINE being gamblers that they know nothing of the laws ENDLINE NEWLINE of probability many men who have passed all their ENDLINE NEWLINE lives among machinery believe confidently in the possibility ENDLINE NEWLINE of perpetual motion they are familiar with ENDLINE NEWLINE machinery but utterly ignorant of mechanics in like ENDLINE NEWLINE manner the life long gambler is familiar with games ENDLINE NEWLINE of chance but utterly ignorant of the laws of chance ENDLINE NEWLINE it may appear paradoxical to say that chance results ENDLINE NEWLINE right themselves nay that there is an absolute ENDLINE NEWLINE certainty that in the long run they will occur as often ENDLINE NEWLINE as their respective chances warrant ENDLINE NEWLINE and at the same time to assert that it is utterly ENDLINE NEWLINE useless for any gambler to trust to this circumstance ENDLINE NEWLINE yet not only is each statement true but it is of first rate ENDLINE NEWLINE importance in the study of our subject that the ENDLINE NEWLINE truth of each should be clearly recognised ENDLINE NEWLINE that the first statement is true will perhaps not be ENDLINE NEWLINE questioned the reasoning on which it is based would ENDLINE NEWLINE be too abstruse for these pages but it has been experimentally ENDLINE NEWLINE verified over and over again thus if a coin ENDLINE NEWLINE be tossed many thousands of times and the numbers ENDLINE NEWLINE of resulting heads and tails be noted it is found ENDLINE NEWLINE not necessarily that these numbers differ from each ENDLINE NEWLINE other by a very small quantity but that their difference ENDLINE NEWLINE is small compared with either in mathematical phrase ENDLINE NEWLINE the two numbers are nearly in a ratio of equality again ENDLINE NEWLINE if a dice be tossed say six million times then although ENDLINE NEWLINE there will not probably have been exactly a million ENDLINE NEWLINE throws of each face yet the number of throws of each ENDLINE NEWLINE face will differ from a million by a quantity very small ENDLINE NEWLINE indeed compared with the total number of throws so ENDLINE NEWLINE certain is this law that it has been made the means of ENDLINE NEWLINE determining the real chances of an event or of ascertaining ENDLINE NEWLINE facts which had been before unknown thus de ENDLINE NEWLINE morgan relates the following story in illustration of ENDLINE NEWLINE this law he received it from a distinguished naval ENDLINE NEWLINE officer who was once employed to bring home a cargo ENDLINE NEWLINE of dollars at the end of the voyage he says it ENDLINE NEWLINE was discovered that one of the boxes which contained ENDLINE NEWLINE them had been forced and on making further search ENDLINE NEWLINE a large bag of dollars was discovered in the possession ENDLINE NEWLINE of some one on board the coins in the different ENDLINE NEWLINE boxes were a mixture of all manner of dates and sovereigns ENDLINE NEWLINE and it occurred to the commander that if the ENDLINE NEWLINE contents of the boxes were sorted a comparison of the ENDLINE NEWLINE proportions of the different sorts in the bag with those ENDLINE NEWLINE in the box which had been opened would afford strong ENDLINE NEWLINE presumptive evidence one way or the other this ENDLINE NEWLINE comparison was accordingly made and the agreement ENDLINE NEWLINE between the distribution of the several coins in the bag ENDLINE NEWLINE and those in the box was such as to leave no doubt as ENDLINE NEWLINE to the former having formed a part of the latter if ENDLINE NEWLINE the bag of stolen dollars had been a small one the ENDLINE NEWLINE inference would have been unsafe but the great number ENDLINE NEWLINE of the dollars corresponded to a great number of chance ENDLINE NEWLINE trials and as in such a large series of trials the several ENDLINE NEWLINE results would be sure to occur in numbers corresponding ENDLINE NEWLINE to their individual chances it followed that the number ENDLINE NEWLINE of coins of the different kinds in the stolen lot would ENDLINE NEWLINE be proportional or very nearly so to the number of ENDLINE NEWLINE those respective coins in the forced box thus in this ENDLINE NEWLINE case the thief increased the strength of the evidence ENDLINE NEWLINE against him by every dollar he added to his ill gotten ENDLINE NEWLINE store ENDLINE NEWLINE we may mention in passing an even more curious ENDLINE NEWLINE application of this law to no less a question than that ENDLINE NEWLINE much talked of but little understood problem the ENDLINE NEWLINE squaring of the circle it can be shown by mathematical ENDLINE NEWLINE reasoning that if a straight rod be so tossed ENDLINE NEWLINE at random into the air as to fall on a grating of equidistant ENDLINE NEWLINE parallel bars the chance of the rod falling ENDLINE NEWLINE through depends on the length and thickness of the ENDLINE NEWLINE rod the distance between the parallel bars the ENDLINE NEWLINE proportion in which the circumference of a circle exceeds ENDLINE NEWLINE the diameter so that when the rod and grating ENDLINE NEWLINE have been carefully measured it is only necessary to ENDLINE NEWLINE know the proportion just mentioned in order to calculate ENDLINE NEWLINE the chance of the rod falling through but also ENDLINE NEWLINE if we can learn in some other way the chance of the rod ENDLINE NEWLINE falling through we can infer the proportion referred to ENDLINE NEWLINE now the law we are considering teaches us that if we ENDLINE NEWLINE only toss the rod often enough the chance of its falling ENDLINE NEWLINE through will be indicated by the number of times it ENDLINE NEWLINE actually does fall through compared with the total ENDLINE NEWLINE number of trials hence we can estimate the proportion ENDLINE NEWLINE in which the circumference of a circle exceeds the ENDLINE NEWLINE diameter by merely tossing a rod over a grating several ENDLINE NEWLINE thousand times and counting how often it falls through ENDLINE NEWLINE the experiment has been tried and professor de morgan ENDLINE NEWLINE tells us that a very excellent evaluation of the celebrated ENDLINE NEWLINE proportion was the result ENDLINE NEWLINE and let it be noticed in passing that this inexorable ENDLINE NEWLINE law for in its effects it is the most inflexible of all the ENDLINE NEWLINE laws of probability shows how fatal it must be to ENDLINE NEWLINE contend long at any game of pure chance where the ENDLINE NEWLINE odds are in favour of our opponent for instance let ENDLINE NEWLINE us assume for a moment that the assertion of the foreign ENDLINE NEWLINE gaming bankers is true and that the chances are but ENDLINE NEWLINE from to per cent or on each or may lose considerably ENDLINE NEWLINE but where thousands of hundreds are wagered the bank ENDLINE NEWLINE will certainly win about their percentage and the players ENDLINE NEWLINE will therefore lose to a corresponding extent this is ENDLINE NEWLINE inevitable so only that the play continue long enough ENDLINE NEWLINE now it is sometimes forgotten that to ensure such gain ENDLINE NEWLINE to the bank it is by no means necessary that the players ENDLINE NEWLINE should come prepared to stake so many hundreds of ENDLINE NEWLINE pounds those who sit down to play may not have a ENDLINE NEWLINE tithe of the sum necessary if only wagered once to ENDLINE NEWLINE ensure the success of the bank but every florin the ENDLINE NEWLINE players bring with them may be and commonly is ENDLINE NEWLINE wagered over and over again there is repeated gain ENDLINE NEWLINE and loss and loss and gain insomuch that the player ENDLINE NEWLINE who finally loses a hundred pounds may have wagered ENDLINE NEWLINE in the course of the sitting a thousand or even many ENDLINE NEWLINE thousand pounds those fortunate beings who break ENDLINE NEWLINE the bank from time to time may even have accomplished ENDLINE NEWLINE the feat of wagering millions during the process ENDLINE NEWLINE which ends in the final loss of the few thousands they ENDLINE NEWLINE may have begun with ENDLINE NEWLINE why is it then it will be asked that this inexorable ENDLINE NEWLINE law is yet not to be trusted for this reason simply ENDLINE NEWLINE that the mode of its operation is altogether uncertain ENDLINE NEWLINE if in a thousand trials there has been a remarkable ENDLINE NEWLINE preponderance of any particular class of events it is ENDLINE NEWLINE not a whit more probable that the preponderance will ENDLINE NEWLINE be compensated by a corresponding deficiency in the ENDLINE NEWLINE next thousand trials than that it will be repeated in ENDLINE NEWLINE that set also the most probable result of the second ENDLINE NEWLINE thousand trials is precisely that result which was most ENDLINE NEWLINE probable for the first thousand that is that there will ENDLINE NEWLINE be no marked preponderance either way but there ENDLINE NEWLINE such a preponderance and it may lie either ENDLINE NEWLINE way it is the same with the next thousand and the ENDLINE NEWLINE next and for every such set they are in no way ENDLINE NEWLINE affected by preceding events in the nature of things ENDLINE NEWLINE how can they be but the whirligig of time brings ENDLINE NEWLINE in its revenges in its own way the balance is restored ENDLINE NEWLINE just as chance directs it may be in the next thousand ENDLINE NEWLINE trials it may be not before many thousands of trials ENDLINE NEWLINE we are utterly unable to guess when or how it will be ENDLINE NEWLINE brought about FINAL
