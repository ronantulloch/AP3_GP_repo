health ENDLINE NEWLINE over a period of time and use the information to forecast the condition of the economy ENDLINE NEWLINE in the future statistical techniques play an important role in achieving the objective ENDLINE NEWLINE of each of these practical situations the development of the theory underlying these ENDLINE NEWLINE techniques is the focus of this text ENDLINE NEWLINE a prerequisite to a discussion of the theory of statistics is a definition of statis ENDLINE NEWLINE tics and a statement of its objectives webster’s new collegiate dictionary defines ENDLINE NEWLINE statistics as “a branch of mathematics dealing with the collection analysis interpre ENDLINE NEWLINE tation and presentation of masses of numerical data” stuart and ord state ENDLINE NEWLINE “statistics is the branch of the scientific method which deals with the data obtained by ENDLINE NEWLINE counting or measuring the properties of populations” rice commenting on ENDLINE NEWLINE experimentation and statistical applications states that statistics is “essentially con ENDLINE NEWLINE cerned with procedures for analyzing data especially data that in some vague sense ENDLINE NEWLINE have a random character” freund and walpole among others view statistics ENDLINE NEWLINE as encompassing “the science of basing inferences on observed data and the entire problem of making decisions in the face of uncertainty” and mood graybill and ENDLINE NEWLINE boes define statistics as “the technology of the scientific method” and add ENDLINE NEWLINE that statistics is concerned with “ the design of experiments and investigations ENDLINE NEWLINE  statistical inference” a superficial examination of these definitions suggests a ENDLINE NEWLINE substantial lack of agreement but all possess common elements each description ENDLINE NEWLINE implies that data are collected with inference as the objective each requires select ENDLINE NEWLINE ing a subset of a large collection of data either existent or conceptual in order to ENDLINE NEWLINE infer the characteristics of the complete set all the authors imply that statistics is a ENDLINE NEWLINE theory of information with inference making as its objective ENDLINE NEWLINE the large body of data that is the target of our interest is called the population and ENDLINE NEWLINE the subset selected from it is a sample the preferences of voters for a gubernatorial ENDLINE NEWLINE candidate jones expressed in quantitative form for “prefer” and for “do not ENDLINE NEWLINE prefer” provide a real finite and existing population of great interest to jones to ENDLINE NEWLINE determine the true fraction who favor his election jones would need to interview ENDLINE NEWLINE all eligible voters—a task that is practically impossible the voltage at a particular ENDLINE NEWLINE point in the guidance system for a spacecraft may be tested in the only three sys ENDLINE NEWLINE tems that have been built the resulting data could be used to estimate the voltage ENDLINE NEWLINE characteristics for other systems that might be manufactured some time in the future ENDLINE NEWLINE in this case the population is conceptual we think of the sample of three as being ENDLINE NEWLINE representative of a large population of guidance systems that could be built using the ENDLINE NEWLINE same method presumably this population would possess characteristics similar to ENDLINE NEWLINE the three systems in the sample analogously measurements on patients in a medical ENDLINE NEWLINE experiment represent a sample from a conceptual population consisting of all patients ENDLINE NEWLINE similarly afflicted today as well as those who will be afflicted in the near future you ENDLINE NEWLINE will find it useful to clearly define the populations of interest for each of the scenarios ENDLINE NEWLINE described earlier in this section and to clarify the inferential objective for each ENDLINE NEWLINE it is interesting to note that billions of dollars are spent each year by us indus ENDLINE NEWLINE try and government for data from experimentation sample surveys and other data ENDLINE NEWLINE collection procedures this money is expended solely to obtain information about ENDLINE NEWLINE phenomena susceptible to measurement in areas of business science or the arts the ENDLINE NEWLINE implications of this statement provide keys to the nature of the very valuable contri ENDLINE NEWLINE bution that the discipline of statistics makes to research and development in all areas ENDLINE NEWLINE of society information useful in inferring some characteristic of a population either ENDLINE NEWLINE existing or conceptual is purchased in a specified quantity and results in an inference ENDLINE NEWLINE estimation or decision with an associated degree of goodness for example if jones ENDLINE NEWLINE arranges for a sample of voters to be interviewed the information in the sample can be ENDLINE NEWLINE used to estimate the true fraction of all voters who favor jones’s election in addition ENDLINE NEWLINE to the estimate itself jones should also be concerned with the likelihood chance ENDLINE NEWLINE that the estimate provided is close to the true fraction of eligible voters who favor his ENDLINE NEWLINE election intuitively the larger the number of eligible voters in the sample the higher ENDLINE NEWLINE will be the likelihood of an accurate estimate similarly if a decision is made regarding ENDLINE NEWLINE the relative merits of two manufacturing processes based on examination of samples ENDLINE NEWLINE of products from both processes we should be interested in the decision regarding ENDLINE NEWLINE which is better and the likelihood that the decision is correct in general the study of ENDLINE NEWLINE statistics is concerned with the design of experiments or sample surveys to obtain a ENDLINE NEWLINE specified quantity of information at minimum cost and the optimum use of this infor ENDLINE NEWLINE mation in making an inference about a population the objective of statistics is to make ENDLINE NEWLINE the mechanism instrumental in making inferences can be well illustrated by analyzing ENDLINE NEWLINE our own intuitive inference making procedures ENDLINE NEWLINE suppose that two candidates are running for a public office in our community ENDLINE NEWLINE and that we wish to determine whether our candidate jones is favored to win the ENDLINE NEWLINE population of interest is the set of responses from all eligible voters who will vote on ENDLINE NEWLINE election day and we wish to determine whether the fraction favoring jones exceeds  ENDLINE NEWLINE for the sake of simplicity suppose that all eligible voters will go to the polls and that ENDLINE NEWLINE we randomly select a sample of from the courthouse roster of voters all are ENDLINE NEWLINE contacted and all favor jones what do you conclude about jones’s prospects for ENDLINE NEWLINE winning the election ENDLINE NEWLINE there is little doubt that most of us would immediately infer that jones will win ENDLINE NEWLINE this is an easy inference to make but this inference itself is not our immediate goal ENDLINE NEWLINE rather we wish to examine the mental processes that were employed in reaching this ENDLINE NEWLINE conclusion about the prospective behavior of a large voting population based on a ENDLINE NEWLINE sample of only people ENDLINE NEWLINE winning means acquiring more than of the votes did we conclude that jones ENDLINE NEWLINE would win because we thought that the fraction favoring jones in the sample was ENDLINE NEWLINE identical to the fraction favoring jones in the population we know that this is prob ENDLINE NEWLINE ably not true a simple experiment will verify that the fraction in the sample favoring ENDLINE NEWLINE jones need not be the same as the fraction of the population who favor him if a bal ENDLINE NEWLINE anced coin is tossed it is intuitively obvious that the true proportion of times it will ENDLINE NEWLINE turn up heads is yet if we sample the outcomes for our coin by tossing it times ENDLINE NEWLINE the proportion of heads will vary from sample to sample that is on one occasion ENDLINE NEWLINE we might observe heads out of flips for a sample proportion of  ENDLINE NEWLINE on another occasion we might observe heads out of flips for a sample pro ENDLINE NEWLINE portion of in fact the sample proportion of heads could be   ENDLINE NEWLINE did we conclude that jones would win because it would be impossible for out ENDLINE NEWLINE of sample voters to favor him if in fact less than of the electorate intended to ENDLINE NEWLINE vote for him the answer to this question is certainly no but it provides the key to ENDLINE NEWLINE our hidden line of logic it is not impossible to draw out of favoring jones when ENDLINE NEWLINE less than of the electorate favor him but it is highly improbable as a result we ENDLINE NEWLINE concluded that he would win ENDLINE
