Statistical techniques are employed in almost every phase of life. Surveys are de-
signed to collect early returns on election day and forecast the outcome of an election.
Consumers are sampled to provide information for predicting product preferences.
Research physicians conduct experiments to determine the effect of various drugs and
controlled environmental conditions on humans in order to infer the appropriate treat-
ment for various illnesses. Engineers sample a product quality characteristic and var-
ious controllable process variables to identify key variables related to product quality.
to ship or hold individual lots. Economists observe various indices of economic health
over a period of time and use the information to forecast the condition of the economy
in the future. Statistical techniques play an important role in achieving the objective
of each of these practical situations. The development of the theory underlying these
techniques is the focus of this text.
A prerequisite to a discussion of the theory of statistics is a definition of statis-
tics and a statement of its objectives. Webster’s New Collegiate Dictionary defines
statistics as “a branch of mathematics dealing with the collection, analysis, interpre-
tation, and presentation of masses of numerical data.” Stuart and Ord (1991) state:
“Statistics is the branch of the scientific method which deals with the data obtained by
counting or measuring the properties of populations.” Rice (1995), commenting on
experimentation and statistical applications, states that statistics is “essentially con-
cerned with procedures for analyzing data, especially data that in some vague sense
have a random character.” Freund and Walpole (1987), among others, view statistics
as encompassing “the science of basing inferences on observed data and the entire problem of making decisions in the face of uncertainty.” And Mood, Graybill, and
Boes (1974) define statistics as “the technology of the scientific method” and add
that statistics is concerned with “(1) the design of experiments and investigations,
(2) statistical inference.” A superficial examination of these definitions suggests a
substantial lack of agreement, but all possess common elements. Each description
implies that data are collected, with inference as the objective. Each requires select-
ing a subset of a large collection of data, either existent or conceptual, in order to
infer the characteristics of the complete set. All the authors imply that statistics is a
theory of information, with inference making as its objective.
The large body of data that is the target of our interest is called the population, and
the subset selected from it is a sample. The preferences of voters for a gubernatorial
candidate, Jones, expressed in quantitative form (1 for “prefer” and 0 for “do not
prefer”) provide a real, finite, and existing population of great interest to Jones. To
determine the true fraction who favor his election, Jones would need to interview
all eligible voters—a task that is practically impossible. The voltage at a particular
point in the guidance system for a spacecraft may be tested in the only three sys-
tems that have been built. The resulting data could be used to estimate the voltage
characteristics for other systems that might be manufactured some time in the future.
In this case, the population is conceptual. We think of the sample of three as being
representative of a large population of guidance systems that could be built using the
same method. Presumably, this population would possess characteristics similar to
the three systems in the sample. Analogously, measurements on patients in a medical
experiment represent a sample from a conceptual population consisting of all patients
similarly afflicted today, as well as those who will be afflicted in the near future. You
will find it useful to clearly define the populations of interest for each of the scenarios
described earlier in this section and to clarify the inferential objective for each.
It is interesting to note that billions of dollars are spent each year by U.S. indus-
try and government for data from experimentation, sample surveys, and other data
collection procedures. This money is expended solely to obtain information about
phenomena susceptible to measurement in areas of business, science, or the arts. The
implications of this statement provide keys to the nature of the very valuable contri-
bution that the discipline of statistics makes to research and development in all areas
of society. Information useful in inferring some characteristic of a population (either
existing or conceptual) is purchased in a specified quantity and results in an inference
(estimation or decision) with an associated degree of goodness. For example, if Jones
arranges for a sample of voters to be interviewed, the information in the sample can be
used to estimate the true fraction of all voters who favor Jones’s election. In addition
to the estimate itself, Jones should also be concerned with the likelihood (chance)
that the estimate provided is close to the true fraction of eligible voters who favor his
election. Intuitively, the larger the number of eligible voters in the sample, the higher
will be the likelihood of an accurate estimate. Similarly, if a decision is made regarding
the relative merits of two manufacturing processes based on examination of samples
of products from both processes, we should be interested in the decision regarding
which is better and the likelihood that the decision is correct. In general, the study of
statistics is concerned with the design of experiments or sample surveys to obtain a
specified quantity of information at minimum cost and the optimum use of this infor-
mation in making an inference about a population. The objective of statistics is to make

The mechanism instrumental in making inferences can be well illustrated by analyzing
our own intuitive inference-making procedures.
Suppose that two candidates are running for a public office in our community
and that we wish to determine whether our candidate, Jones, is favored to win. The
population of interest is the set of responses from all eligible voters who will vote on
election day, and we wish to determine whether the fraction favoring Jones exceeds .5.
For the sake of simplicity, suppose that all eligible voters will go to the polls and that
we randomly select a sample of 20 from the courthouse roster of voters. All 20 are
contacted and all favor Jones. What do you conclude about Jones’s prospects for
winning the election?
There is little doubt that most of us would immediately infer that Jones will win.
This is an easy inference to make, but this inference itself is not our immediate goal.
Rather, we wish to examine the mental processes that were employed in reaching this
conclusion about the prospective behavior of a large voting population based on a
sample of only 20 people.
Winning means acquiring more than 50% of the votes. Did we conclude that Jones
would win because we thought that the fraction favoring Jones in the sample was
identical to the fraction favoring Jones in the population? We know that this is prob-
ably not true. A simple experiment will verify that the fraction in the sample favoring
Jones need not be the same as the fraction of the population who favor him. If a bal-
anced coin is tossed, it is intuitively obvious that the true proportion of times it will
turn up heads is .5. Yet if we sample the outcomes for our coin by tossing it 20 times,
the proportion of heads will vary from sample to sample; that is, on one occasion
we might observe 12 heads out of 20 flips, for a sample proportion of 12/20 = .6.
On another occasion, we might observe 8 heads out of 20 flips, for a sample pro-
portion of 8/20 = .4. In fact, the sample proportion of heads could be 0, .05, .10,

Did we conclude that Jones would win because it would be impossible for 20 out
of 20 sample voters to favor him if in fact less than 50% of the electorate intended to
vote for him? The answer to this question is certainly no, but it provides the key to
our hidden line of logic. It is not impossible to draw 20 out of 20 favoring Jones when
less than 50% of the electorate favor him, but it is highly improbable. As a result, we
concluded that he would win.
